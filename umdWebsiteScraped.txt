FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges
We invest in people and communities
We partner to advance the public good
OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

DARRYLL J. PINES
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  is a living document and will evolve and grow as we do. Please visit this site to follow our progress as we move fearlessly forward.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

ABOUT TDPS IN THE 2024 HELEN HAYES AWARD NOMINATIONS
1/5
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies advances and transforms the research and practice of theatre, dance, and performance studies through a commitment to inclusive excellence and educational innovation in the performing arts.
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.

We enjoyed conversing about my background in activism and my senior project so much that we met again to talk about filmmaking techniques. I was offered a production assistant position with his affiliate with a film that he's creating. Lastly, [my Intern for a Day host] told me that I could intern at his office and use the TV studio for any short film I wanted to make.

Anticipating Excellence
By Darryll J. Pines
January 24, 2024
This past Sunday, we welcomed four new Terps to the University of Maryland family, and acceptance letters will be delivered to thousands more of our future undergraduates later this month.
The excitement and the optimism expressed by our #NowATerp families matches the sense of hope I feel for the semester we begin today.
Like them, I anticipate excellence in what lies ahead. Academic pursuits and new ways of thinking that we have not yet imagined. The thrill of a scene-stealing performance or an athletic triumph. Countless opportunities to Do Good.
I hope you draw on the enthusiasm of our newest Terps and embrace the possibilities of a new year and a fresh start. May spring 2024 be your best semester yet!
Sincerely,
Darryll J. Pines

Standing the Testudo of Time
From Turtlenappings to TikTok Shenanigans, How an Unassuming Reptile Evolved to Represent Terp Spirit
By
 Maryland Today Staff

 
 
 Jan 26, 2024

Let’s be honest. A turtle’s an odd choice for a college mascot, up there with Syracuse’s Otto the Orange, UC Santa Cruz’s Sammy the Slug and Stanford’s Tree.
Turtles are slow. Most aren’t big, strong or intimidating. They can’t leap, mountain lion-like, out of a tree to maul you, or crack you one across the noggin with a shillelagh—and really, is that a bad thing?
Instead, these can-do reptiles impress with their positive attributes: They’re persistent and tough. Diamondback terrapins scream (as if turtles make a lot of noise) “Maryland pride” in a state where residents don scarves, overalls and even suits in the flag’s colors.
The University of Maryland loves its Testudo, in every form the mascot takes. He’s the gravitas-heavy, inspirational bronze sculpture that students make offerings to during finals. He’s the furry goofball that dances in the student section at football games, that wears a yellow rain hat and poncho with adorable panache. He’s the logo on our hoodies, the pin on our lapels.
He’s at the center of UMD’s most treasured traditions. And he might have originally been a she.
Testudo has evolved in more ways than one. With the help of University Archivist Emerita Anne Turkos, we delve into our mascot’s muddy origin story, his role in an outrageous, yearslong prank war and his wackiest iterations.
“There are few things I enjoy talking about more than Testudo,” she says. “There’s no mascot quite like him, and he’s had quite a history.”
A Symbol Emerges
Taxidermied Testudo photo by John T. Consoli
Millennia before “Terp” became a Maryland moniker, it was on the region’s menu. Bountiful and easy to catch, the terrapin provided sustenance to Native Americans; once it made the Colonial culinary cut, you could find it roasted, poached and stewed with cream and sherry. By the early 20th century, the hero of these dishes was so popular that the species faced extinction.
In 1932, 11 years after he christened the student newspaper The Diamondback, then-Vice President Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd lobbied for the reptile (scientific name: Testudines) to serve as the university’s mascot—and replace student-athletes’ identity as the Old Liners. When the Class of 1933 proposed a terrapin statue for its class gift, Byrd arranged for a diamondback to be plucked from the waters of Crisfield, Md., to serve as a model. Named the “Archbishop” by students (and assumed to be male—although a 2018 analysis suggests it may indeed have been female), the 13-inch terrapin traveled by train to Gorham Manufacturing Co. in Rhode Island with the student government association president. There, sculptor Aristide Cianfarani designed a giant replica in bronze, which Gorham cast.
Archie returned to campus, but her—or his?—fame was short-lived. The terrapin died days after two holes were drilled into its shell to fashion a ribbon pull for the elaborate (and slow) unveiling of the 5-foot-long likeness at a ceremony in front of Ritchie Coliseum. The likely cause: stress and the hot weather. (Drilling the holes, it was determined, did not hurt the terrapin.)
Terrapin Travails
Who would have guessed a 300-pound bronze statue was so portable? And yet, the shiny new mascot was pulled from his pedestal just before the first anniversary of its installation. The turtlenappers brazenly painted “J.H.U.” in green on the now-empty perch, the first in a trail of “clues” that led UMD to the sculpture outside a Johns Hopkins University dorm the very day it went missing.
It was just the first of Testudo’s 12 disappearances in 15 years, The Diamondback reported in 1958. Some pranks were linked to the UMD-Hopkins lacrosse rivalry, but Georgetown, George Washington and even Loyola University of Maryland students pitched in as well; at their most ambitious, the thieves took the turtle on unsanctioned trips to the University of Virginia and, according to rumor, as far away as Florida. A 1947 caper, in which Hopkins students buried Testudo in Baltimore, ended with a riot and arrests (and reportedly, an eventual party) after UMD partisans stormed a residence hall at the Homewood campus.
Fed-up UMD administrators packed the statue away in storage for a few years after that. He was then installed outside the new football stadium in 1951—far from getaway-friendly Route 1 and now filled with hundreds of pounds of concrete to prevent further attempts. Then, in 1965, Testudo moved to its permanent (and most visible, theft-deterring) home outside McKeldin Library.

Besides rubbing Testudo’s nose for good luck, students have left offerings to the statue outside McKeldin during finals week in hope of earning good grades since the 1990s. Like turtles themselves, the tradition has evolved, as gifts of pocket change, notes and flowers turned to beer cans and coffee cups.
In more recent years, Terps’ offerings looked more like pranks, including a life-size cutout of Pope Francis, a toilet and stolen traffic cones; a fire even broke out in the pile in 2013.
Last semester, a coalition of student associations appealed to Terps’ goodwill, encouraging students to instead drop off donations of nonperishable foods for the Campus Pantry at his pedestal.

THE ERAS TOUR
Like a comic book superhero, how artists imagine Testudo has radically changed over the decades. (Also superherolike: Testudo’s definitely muscled up.) Illustrations in UMD yearbooks depict him as a delinquent, a ladies’ man, a daydreamer, a sleep-inducing teacher, an astronaut, athlete and proud grad. Here are some standouts:
Reptile Roundup

If you hit the Aberdeen, Md., rest stop off I-95 in the summer of 2006, chances are that a 4-foot-tall painted Testudo greeted you. Same at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, Arundel Mills mall and other popular destinations across the state. For UMD’s 150th anniversary, 50 formidable fiberglass Testudos were transformed into a variety of personas—from a tribute to the Chesapeake Bay and a Mighty Sound of Maryland drum major to a Mutant Ninja Turtle and a spangly disco ball. The Fear the Turtle statues returned to College Park that fall to be auctioned off, raising nearly $300,000 for scholarships. Several ended up in private homes, but 10 remain on campus:
“The Freshman”: Turner Hall lobby
“Champions All”: Hornbake Library lobby
“Hear the Turtle”: near the Band Office, The Clarice
“Kertle” and “College Park Arts Exchange”: The Stamp
“Metalli Terp”: near the Dean’s Office, School of Public Health
“Mutant Ninja Terrapin”: outside the Center for Young Children
“Turning into Super Terp”: inside Gate B, Xfinity Center
“A Turtle Celebration”: outside LeFrak Hall
“Tuxudo”: Moxley Gardens at the Riggs Alumni Center
“Maryland Pride”: outside University House
Suited for the Role

The furry, funny Testudo mascot is the Terps’ top cheerleader. He cartwheels on the sidelines, shakes his turtle tush on viral TikTok dances and poses for selfies with fans. But he didn’t always look this way (and definitely didn’t have these moves).
Since then, dozens of men and women have donned the costume, including Grant Handley ’22, M.P.P. ’23. He shells out what it takes to be Maryland’s mascot:
BE EVERYWHERE (BUT NO OVERLAPS!)
Testudo’s a busy turtle, greeting families during move-in, high-fiving kids during Maryland Day, hobnobbing with the governor during announcements and, of course, attending sports games. But he’ll never be in two places at the same time.
THINK ON YOUR FEET
“A mascot should never be standing around—they should always be miming or reacting to something,” says Handley, who uses props and improv to perform at all times. That includes dealing with difficult opposing fans: “You have to figure out how to defuse that situation.”
KEEP IT MOVING
“We joke that you have to be in ‘mascot shape,’” says Handley. The suit weighs at least 30 pounds—the head is the heaviest part—so the four or five students on the team each year always have to hit the gym.
DON’T SPILL THE BEANS
Team members have to keep their identity a secret from everyone, and they can’t speak or show any skin. (The Oregon Duck’s head falling off at a game last fall was “nightmare fuel,” says Handley).
BE CONFIDENT—NOT COCKY
Testudo’s known for his one-handed chest pound, but he’s not an in-your-face mascot. “He might grab someone’s hat and dangle it in their face. And when children come, he’ll get low so he’s not intimidating,” says Handley. “He’s a friendly, lovable turtle.”

The first known photograph of a Testudo mascot was in 1951, when Zeta Beta Tau members perched on goalposts in masks, shells and street clothes. By the end of the decade, ZBT mascots were banned for being “costumed poorly” and acting “in a disorderly fashion,” The Diamondback wrote.
Testudo ... Now in 3D!

Beyond the bronze Testudos, thousands more in their likeness have been produced in materials ranging from everyday plastics to exotic metals by 3D printers at Terrapin Works, a unit of the A. James Clark School of Engineering.
“Whenever we’re trying out new technology, Testudo gives us a uniform basis for comparison—and it’s uniquely Maryland on top of that,” says Jim Zahniser, Clark School assistant dean for strategic operations and IT.

Former UMD President C.D. “Dan” Mote, Jr. (1998-2010) began handing out golden lapel pins to VIPs and other outstanding Terps to show off Maryland spirit. The design was tweaked for successor Wallace D. Loh (2010-20), who began distributing them more widely. President Darryll J. Pines is sticking with the practice, sharing his version with everyone he meets.

Like a comic book superhero, how artists imagine Testudo has radically changed over the decades. (Also superherolike: Testudo’s definitely muscled up.) Illustrations in UMD yearbooks depict him as a delinquent, a ladies’ man, a daydreamer, a sleep-inducing teacher, an astronaut, athlete and proud grad. Here are some standouts:

If you hit the Aberdeen, Md., rest stop off I-95 in the summer of 2006, chances are that a 4-foot-tall painted Testudo greeted you. Same at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, Arundel Mills mall and other popular destinations across the state. For UMD’s 150th anniversary, 50 formidable fiberglass Testudos were transformed into a variety of personas—from a tribute to the Chesapeake Bay and a Mighty Sound of Maryland drum major to a Mutant Ninja Turtle and a spangly disco ball. The Fear the Turtle statues returned to College Park that fall to be auctioned off, raising nearly $300,000 for scholarships. Several ended up in private homes, but 10 remain on campus:
“The Freshman”: Turner Hall lobby
“Champions All”: Hornbake Library lobby
“Hear the Turtle”: near the Band Office, The Clarice
“Kertle” and “College Park Arts Exchange”: The Stamp
“Metalli Terp”: near the Dean’s Office, School of Public Health
“Mutant Ninja Terrapin”: outside the Center for Young Children
“Turning into Super Terp”: inside Gate B, Xfinity Center
“A Turtle Celebration”: outside LeFrak Hall
“Tuxudo”: Moxley Gardens at the Riggs Alumni Center
“Maryland Pride”: outside University House
Suited for the Role

The furry, funny Testudo mascot is the Terps’ top cheerleader. He cartwheels on the sidelines, shakes his turtle tush on viral TikTok dances and poses for selfies with fans. But he didn’t always look this way (and definitely didn’t have these moves).
Since then, dozens of men and women have donned the costume, including Grant Handley ’22, M.P.P. ’23. He shells out what it takes to be Maryland’s mascot:
BE EVERYWHERE (BUT NO OVERLAPS!)
Testudo’s a busy turtle, greeting families during move-in, high-fiving kids during Maryland Day, hobnobbing with the governor during announcements and, of course, attending sports games. But he’ll never be in two places at the same time.
THINK ON YOUR FEET
“A mascot should never be standing around—they should always be miming or reacting to something,” says Handley, who uses props and improv to perform at all times. That includes dealing with difficult opposing fans: “You have to figure out how to defuse that situation.”
KEEP IT MOVING
“We joke that you have to be in ‘mascot shape,’” says Handley. The suit weighs at least 30 pounds—the head is the heaviest part—so the four or five students on the team each year always have to hit the gym.
DON’T SPILL THE BEANS
Team members have to keep their identity a secret from everyone, and they can’t speak or show any skin. (The Oregon Duck’s head falling off at a game last fall was “nightmare fuel,” says Handley).
BE CONFIDENT—NOT COCKY
Testudo’s known for his one-handed chest pound, but he’s not an in-your-face mascot. “He might grab someone’s hat and dangle it in their face. And when children come, he’ll get low so he’s not intimidating,” says Handley. “He’s a friendly, lovable turtle.”

1950s
The first known photograph of a Testudo mascot was in 1951, when Zeta Beta Tau members perched on goalposts in masks, shells and street clothes. By the end of the decade, ZBT mascots were banned for being “costumed poorly” and acting “in a disorderly fashion,” The Diamondback wrote.
Testudo ... Now in 3D!

Beyond the bronze Testudos, thousands more in their likeness have been produced in materials ranging from everyday plastics to exotic metals by 3D printers at Terrapin Works, a unit of the A. James Clark School of Engineering.
“Whenever we’re trying out new technology, Testudo gives us a uniform basis for comparison—and it’s uniquely Maryland on top of that,” says Jim Zahniser, Clark School assistant dean for strategic operations and IT.

Former UMD President C.D. “Dan” Mote, Jr. (1998-2010) began handing out golden lapel pins to VIPs and other outstanding Terps to show off Maryland spirit. The design was tweaked for successor Wallace D. Loh (2010-20), who began distributing them more widely. President Darryll J. Pines is sticking with the practice, sharing his version with everyone he meets.

This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one and it may be both moral and physical, but [it] must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and never will.

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges
We invest in people and communities
We partner to advance the public good
OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:
United
We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space. To that extent we depend on one another and are our best selves when we support one another. Accordingly, our actions are guided not only by what is good for self but also by what is good for all.

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

WE TAKE ON HUMANITY'S GRAND CHALLENGES
WE INVEST IN PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES
WE PARTNER TO ADVANCE THE PUBLIC GOOD
FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges
We invest in people and communities
We partner to advance the public good
OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

1/5
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies advances and transforms the research and practice of theatre, dance, and performance studies through a commitment to inclusive excellence and educational innovation in the performing arts.
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.

Mission Statement
Studio A, formerly known as The Art and Learning Center, is an interactive center encouraging the self-expression and self-development of the UMD community. We offer a creative outlet for students, faculty/staff, and community members via non-credit courses in the arts. Through our weekly classes and frequent workshops, we provide the opportunity to learn new skills, explore a topic, or pursue a creative passion. In addition, we serve as a creative partner for student groups, campus organizations, and departments by offering a physical space and environment for people to come together and create. We encourage people to engage individually and as a team with different modes of perception and expression.

We enjoyed conversing about my background in activism and my senior project so much that we met again to talk about filmmaking techniques. I was offered a production assistant position with his affiliate with a film that he's creating. Lastly, [my Intern for a Day host] told me that I could intern at his office and use the TV studio for any short film I wanted to make.

Media Policy
In a continued effort to keep our community safe during the
 COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Maryland has instituted
 special media guidelines. Please review 
 our Media Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic
 before coming to campus.
The University Communications office aims to service media requests
 with accurate, transparent and timely information. We partner with
 the media to help tell the story of the university and its
 leadership faculty, staff, students and alumni.
As a public institution, the university permits media
 representatives to photograph and film in public, outdoor spaces on
 UMD's campus. We encourage all members of the media who are visiting
 to notify University Communications in advance by emailing 
 mediainfo@umd.edu
 , calling 301.257.0073 or communicating
 directly with any member of the University Communications staff. This
 allows us to help coordinate interviews, if possible, offer parking options
 and provide helpful information. Exceptions include members of the media
 covering athletic events. These individuals should coordinate directly
 with the 
 Maryland Athletics media relations team
MEDIA POLICY AND FAQS
On-Campus Filming
News media who plan to film or photograph on UMD's campus
 are asked to notify University Communications in advance. As a public
 institution, the university permits media representatives to photograph
 and film in public, outdoor spaces on UMD's campus. However, media are
 not permitted to photograph or film inside any building on campus without
 explicit permission from University Communications.
All commercial filming and photography must be coordinated
 and approved through the University Communications office in advance.
 All requests for commercial filming on campus must be accompanied by
 a completed filming application. Filming fees may apply. Applications
 must be submitted to University Communications a minimum of 10 business
 days priors to the requested film date.

The best way to receive inclement weather notifications directly is to make sure you are signed up for UMD text alerts. 
Updates regarding UMD’s closures, delays and other schedule changes, will be announced through various channels, including:
UMD Alerts via text message and email
UMD homepage (www.umd.edu)
X/Twitter (@President_Pines, @UMDRightNow and @UofMaryland)
UMD Snowline (x5-SNOW or 301-405-7669)
The university will not make an announcement if the campus is open and operating under normal operations. The university makes every effort to communicate changes to campus operations by 4:30 a.m. Local media outlets often cover changes to university operations; however, for the most up-to-date information, please check the university sites listed.
How does the university decide when to close the university for inclement weather?
During a full campus closure, what offices and departments close?
Who are essential employees?
How are student services affected when the university is closed?
How can I find out about impacts to transportation and parking?
If my class falls partially during a period when the university is closed, will it still be held?
How do I find additional information about classes that are changed from in-person to virtual? 
Are athletic events canceled when the university is closed?
Are performances at The Clarice canceled when the university is closed?
Does the university’s closure only apply to College Park?

The University of Maryland (UMD) is committed to our graduate students and to the more than 230 programs in which they are enrolled. Our graduate student community consists of approximately 10,500 students, 4,600 of whom are pursuing a PhD, 5,200 who are enrolled in traditional and professional master’s programs, and nearly 700 who are not yet seeking a degree but are enrolled in graduate courses or certificate programs. International students make up more than 40 percent of our graduate student population, women comprise close to 50 percent, and minorities comprise nearly 20 percent. We pride ourselves on our diverse and stimulating campus culture.
In many ways, graduate study is an apprenticeship. To be successful, you must commit to hours of concentrated work, independent research, and original writing. Graduate work takes time, patience, focus, discipline, and the willingness to make many personal sacrifices. Despite those challenges, the UMD campus, the Washington, DC metropolitan area, and the graduate student community can provide a most agreeable environment.
We are delighted that you are considering a graduate program at the University of Maryland, College Park. We offer a wide array of distinguished programs in many disciplines, and we encourage you to explore them to find the one that best aligns with your interests. Please be sure to read all instructions and requirements carefully to ensure a proper and complete application, and to avoid mistakes that may delay the consideration of your application. Also, remember that the Graduate School and your program of interest are here to help guide you through the admissions process. Feel free to contact us with questions.

The University of Maryland aims for excellence in all things. We are committed to providing students from all backgrounds with pathways to accessible and affordable education by opening doors for talent and promise.
  The University of Maryland has launched a new investment in need-based financial aid, the Terrapin Commitment program, which will provide up to $20 million annually for students from the state of Maryland.
The goal of the Terrapin Commitment program is to reduce the gap between a student’s total financial aid package and the cost of an education. The program began in January 2023 ensuring that tuition and fees are fully covered for Pell eligible, in-state students who are enrolled full-time and have unmet financial need. Learn more>>

HOME TERRAPIN COMMITMENT
Terrapin Commitment
The University of Maryland has launched a new investment in need-based financial aid, providing up to $20 million annually for students from the state of Maryland.
“Since day one of my presidency, I have emphasized the importance of increasing financial support and access to our university. Every Maryland student deserves an equal opportunity to attend the state’s flagship university, and the Terrapin Commitment grant is one more measure we are taking to ensure that a University of Maryland education is affordable to all residents of our state.” —UMD President, Darryll J. Pines
This Terrapin Commitment, the largest single-year investment in need-based scholarships in our university’s history, is designed to ensure that a UMD education is affordable to all residents of our state. The goal of the Terrapin Commitment grant is to reduce the gap between a student’s total financial aid package and the actual cost of an education. Terrapin Commitment began in January 2023, ensuring that UMD’s standard in-state tuition and fees are fully covered for Pell-eligible, in-state students who are enrolled full-time and have unmet financial need, dramatically reducing the financial barriers to obtaining a higher education for low-income Marylanders.
“In alignment with our Fearlessly Forward strategic plan, we continue to find new and meaningful ways to invest in people and communities. Our investments in need-based financial aid better position us to serve the people of our state—opening the door for more Marylanders to attend a world-class flagship institution.” —UMD Senior Vice President and Provost Jennifer King Rice
If an eligible UMD student’s funding sources—including scholarships, grants and the expected family contribution—fall below standard in-state UMD tuition and mandatory fees, Terrapin Commitment will pay the difference. Additional information about eligibility and frequently asked questions can be found below.
ELIGIBILITY
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
To be considered for the Terrapin Commitment grant, students must meet the following criteria:
Be classified as an undergraduate, degree-seeking in-state student.
Enroll full-time (12+ credits) per semester (Fall/Spring).
Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year and qualify to receive the Federal Pell Grant. If ineligible for federal financial aid, complete the Maryland State Financial Aid Application (MSFAA) and qualify to receive the state's Educational Assistance Grant or the Guaranteed Access Grant.
Maintain satisfactory academic progress.

Accessibility
Welcome!
Maryland is a wonderful and diverse community. Diversity is one of our core values and our campus is strengthened and enriched by people with disabilities. Accessibility is an approach to communication and engagement that recognizes the intersectional identities, experiences, and needs of our entire campus community. It goes beyond legal accommodations for students, staff and faculty with disabilities. We work towards making this a community where we each can bring our whole self to campus, where we each have the opportunity to thrive.
We do this in three main ways:
by working towards building a strong community of people with disabilities on our campus
by interrupting structural, attitudinal and institutional barriers that hinder equal access to university-sponsored programs and activities
by being a community that values all persons with disabilities as integral members of our campus community
This website is designed to connect people with services and information related to all aspects of accessibility. If you are experiencing difficulty accessing a university website, or content located on a university website (video, document, etc.), please contact itaccessibility@umd.edu.
The ADA/504 coordinator's office guides the university's efforts to move beyond compliance and toward seamless access. As the university's focal point for disability-related initiatives, the ADA/504 coordinator's office collaborates with university offices, government agencies and advocacy groups to inform decision-making and ensure university compliance with state and federal mandates. The office addresses accessibility issues and reports of disability-based discrimination on campus.
To contact the ADA/504 coordinator’s office:
Phone: 301-405-2841

HomePublic Information Request
Public Information Request
The Maryland Public Information Act (PIA), gives the public the right to review and obtain copies of disclosable public records, except to the extent the records are protected from release because they fall within a statutorily recognized exemption to the law. Disclosable public records are only those made or received by a unit of State government in connection with the transaction of public business. In addition, the PIA does not require UM to answer informational questions or to create a record to satisfy a request. Your correspondence to the University making a request is itself a public record and may be asked for by other requesters, along with the University’s response.
  SUBMIT A REQUEST
VIEW PDF PIA ACT MANUAL
The PIA is found in the General Provisions Article, §§4-101 through 4-601, of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and accessible through the Maryland State Law Library at www.lawlib.state.md.us.
  The Maryland Office of the Attorney General provides a Public Information Act Manual which contains the law itself, along with narrative descriptions of the manner in which the law applies to different types of requests. The Manual is available to the public on-line, and provides meaningful assistance to members of the public and records custodians. For the table of contents and access to the complete Manual, click here.
Information for University Units
If you receive a request for documents, do not respond to the request yourself. If someone would like to file a request, you may direct them to our portal.
Regardless of whether the request specifically cites Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, the federal equivalent) or Public Information Act (PIA), you should immediately forward the request to the UM Office of General Counsel.
UM has 10 business days to acknowledge a request and a limited amount of time to provide records after a request is received, so acting promptly is important.
Electronic mail messages and voice mail messages created during the transaction of public business are owned by the University and included in the definition of “public record.” This includes records created or housed on personal devices (mobile phones, tablets, email accounts, laptops etc.)
If you have questions or need advice, contact the Office of General Counsel.
Information for Requestors
To review or obtain copies of University of Maryland, College Park records, you must make a written request under Maryland’s Public Information Act (“PIA”).
Requests for information related to Undergraduate Admissions, Graduate Admissions or Transcripts should be directed to those particular offices.
Requests for the University of Maryland, College Park may be filed via U.S. Mail or through our portal. Sending your request to an individual University employee will delay its receipt and processing.
Public record requests for other schools within the University System of Maryland (USM) must be filed directly with that institution. For example, a request for the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) cannot be filed with the College Park campus.
When filing a request, be specific with respect to time frames, contents, and keywords. Inquiries should contain a targeted description of the record to enable the University to locate the requested record. Be simple, straightforward and precise.
Requests which ask for “any and all” records without any other limiters typically result in vague and overbroad requests. In addition, processing such requests incurs high costs for the requester.
Disclosable public records are only those made or received by a unit of State government in connection with the transaction of public business.
Requests may be submitted at any time. However, requests can only be received when the University is open for business. The date of receipt is the date used for processing the inquiry.
Upon receipt, the University will perform a preliminary assessment of your request to determine if the University is the appropriate custodian of the records. The University will also review the request for completeness.
If the request is unclear or unreasonably broad, the University may request that the filer clarify or narrow the request.
Requests are then placed in a queue of other public records requests. Other offices across campus which may have the records sought are notified about the request. This begins the process of identifying, collecting and reviewing potentially responsive materials to a filer. In certain cases, third parties with an interest may be consulted to process the inquiry.
The PIA is not an automatic disclosure process; requests may be denied. There are circumstances when requests for public information may be denied because there is information which is not lawfully available to the public. This may include, for example, personnel records, student education records; records concerning on-going research; classified information; and information considered confidential commercial/financial information.
The University may reject requests for student directory information (i.e. name, address, email address, phone number) when sought for a commercial purpose.
In the procurement context, requests for the following will be denied: line-item pricing, unit price information, a successful bidder’s customer list, evaluation forms and/or score sheets and biographical data on key employees.
In the research context, specific details of on-going research projects will not be disclosed.
The General Provisions Article, §4-330 provides, “If the official custodian has adopted rules or regulations that define sociological information . . . a custodian shall deny inspection of the part of a public record which contains sociological information . . .” Thus, University’s Rules on Public Records Containing Sociological Information are intended to define the conditions under which Sociological Information shall be excluded from inspection and disclosure as part of a public record under Maryland’s Public Information Act.
Your correspondence to the University making a request may itself a public record and can be requested by other filers, along with the University’s response.
The University will respond as efficiently as possible based on factors including the availability of records, the complexity of the request, the volume of materials involved, the number of requests in the queue, and the time required to review the materials for possible redactions to protect the privacy rights of students or employees or other information deemed confidential under federal or state law.
Our ultimate goal is to be responsive to each and every of the almost 500 requests received annually.
Search & Preparation Fees
Pursuant to Section 4-206, to the University may recover its costs for the actual time expended for the search, preparation, legal review and reproduction of records, to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, UM may not charge a fee for the first 2 hours that are needed to search for a public record and prepare it for inspection. Consequently, we encourage filers to be explicit and precise when drafting their requests.
To offer the most efficient customer service, the University requires payment for any estimated amount due before the work is performed. The search, preparation and copying process will begin upon receipt of the total estimated fee. If the actual fee differs from the estimate, the fee will be adjusted accordingly, and you will receive an additional bill or refund as appropriate.
Requesters will be notified in advance of any fees to be assessed prior to execution. The requester will then have an opportunity to revise or narrow the scope of a request to avoid or reduce actual costs.
Please make your money order or check payable to the "University of Maryland" and send it to the Office of General Counsel. You may also hand-deliver this payment. The University does not accept cash through the mail, credit cards, or PayPal.
If the University does not receive your payment within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of our reply, it will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request and close the file accordingly. To obtain the documents, you must submit a new request.
If a filer feels that the University has imposed an unreasonable fee (more than $350) to produce the responsive documents, the filer may seek assistance from the State Public Information Act Compliance Board (GP Section 4-1A-01 et seq.).
Remedies
Comments or questions for the University may be directed to: PublicInformationAct@umd.edu
Filers who disagree with any response to a PIA request, may seek review of the decision in accordance with Section 4-362 of the PIA. In addition, they may seek assistance from the Public Access Ombudsperson under GP Section 4-1B-01 et seq.
If a filer feels that the University has imposed an unreasonable fee (more than $350) to produce the responsive documents, the filer may seek assistance from the State Public Information Act Compliance Board (GP Section 4-1A-01 et seq.).
Freedom of Information Act
Occasionally an individual or entity will submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a Federal Government agency, and the request will include copies of proposals submitted to funding agencies. If a Federal agency contacts you directly with a FOIA request, please immediately forward the request to the Office of Research Administration. Federal agencies often must operate on a 5-day turn-around for FOIA requests, so it is imperative that ORA and OGC work with you to protect from disclosure (1) any information that may give rise to patentable technology, or (2) information not currently known to others in the researcher’s field that if disclosed, could damage the researcher’s chances of publishing finding as an original and innovative contribution to the field. If you believe that portions of the documents should be withheld, provide your ORA Contract Administrator with the appropriate sections and/or page numbers and the rationale for withholding the information. ORA will work with OGC to prepare a letter requesting that the agency withhold this information from disclosure.
Ownership of Emails and Other Records
Maryland's Public Information Act (PIA), Md. Code Ann., General Provisions Article (“GP”) §§ 4- 101 through 4-601, grants a broad right of access to public records while protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens. As a result, a person can request access to University records and, unless the records fall within a list of exceptions to PIA, the University is required to disclose records that match the request. For instance, a requestor might request a copy of the University’s construction contract for new building or budget information. A requestor may ask for state employee email communications. UMD’s computing and digital information resources are the property of the State of Maryland and, as a result, are subject to the PIA. A requestor can even ask for a list of employees' salaries. However, a requestor cannot ask for a copy of an employee's personnel file or a list of employees' social security numbers and home addresses.

Accessibility
Welcome!
Maryland is a wonderful and diverse community. Diversity is one of our core values and our campus is strengthened and enriched by people with disabilities. Accessibility is an approach to communication and engagement that recognizes the intersectional identities, experiences, and needs of our entire campus community. It goes beyond legal accommodations for students, staff and faculty with disabilities. We work towards making this a community where we each can bring our whole self to campus, where we each have the opportunity to thrive.
We do this in three main ways:
by working towards building a strong community of people with disabilities on our campus
by interrupting structural, attitudinal and institutional barriers that hinder equal access to university-sponsored programs and activities
by being a community that values all persons with disabilities as integral members of our campus community
This website is designed to connect people with services and information related to all aspects of accessibility. If you are experiencing difficulty accessing a university website, or content located on a university website (video, document, etc.), please contact itaccessibility@umd.edu.
The ADA/504 coordinator's office guides the university's efforts to move beyond compliance and toward seamless access. As the university's focal point for disability-related initiatives, the ADA/504 coordinator's office collaborates with university offices, government agencies and advocacy groups to inform decision-making and ensure university compliance with state and federal mandates. The office addresses accessibility issues and reports of disability-based discrimination on campus.

Ethics, Integrity and Compliance Reporting
To report an emergency or if someone is in danger, please call 911.
Information about reporting sexual misconduct may be found here.
If you have concerns about COVID-19 or any public health practices, please talk with your supervisor or other university manager, or use the form on the UMD Compliance reporting system.
The University of Maryland is committed to fostering a culture of ethics, integrity and compliance. Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic includes health and safety responsibilities for everyone.
The University of Maryland is committed to an open and honest campus environment, and we ask you to support this commitment. We want you to feel comfortable approaching your supervisor or other manager in instances where you believe violations of policies or standards may have occurred. We encourage reports of questionable activities you have witnessed or experienced. This ensures UMD is following the highest standard of ethics.
In situations in which you prefer to make a confidential or anonymous report, you are encouraged to use the UMD Compliance reporting system. It is a safe way to report problems or raise concerns. It is administered for UMD by UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND EthicsPoint, an independent trusted solution to confidentially manage reports of possible irregularities or misconduct. If you wish, your report will be anonymous.
The reporting system is always available (24/7) to document your concerns. It is not for reporting criminal or medical emergencies. To access the reporting system, click here or call 1.844.607.1491. Spanish translation is available by calling the phone line; translation into other languages is available on request.
All submissions are reviewed and reports of noncompliance are investigated. It is important to be as specific as possible if you choose to remain anonymous so that your concern may be addressed.

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning

OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

STUDY FINDS 2021 CICADA EMERGENCE CHANGED FOREST FOOD WEBS
When Brood X cicadas emerged by the billions in 2021 after 17 years underground, dozens of species of birds pulled up a table at a bug buffet, helping to create a cascading series of ecological effects, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland and other institutions. In their publication featured this month on the cover of the journal&nbsp;Science, the team from UMD, including College Park Scholars Life Sciences program alum Grace Soltis, George Washington University and Georgetown University quantified the widespread changes the periodical cicada emergence had on the feeding patterns of birds and its downstream effects on forest food webs.

ABOUT TDPS IN THE 2024 HELEN HAYES AWARD NOMINATIONS
1/5
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies advances and transforms the research and practice of theatre, dance, and performance studies through a commitment to inclusive excellence and educational innovation in the performing arts.
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.

Studio A, formerly known as The Art and Learning Center, is an interactive center encouraging the self-expression and self-development of the UMD community. We offer a creative outlet for students, faculty/staff, and community members via non-credit courses in the arts. Through our weekly classes and frequent workshops, we provide the opportunity to learn new skills, explore a topic, or pursue a creative passion. In addition, we serve as a creative partner for student groups, campus organizations, and departments by offering a physical space and environment for people to come together and create. We encourage people to engage individually and as a team with different modes of perception and expression.

We enjoyed conversing about my background in activism and my senior project so much that we met again to talk about filmmaking techniques. I was offered a production assistant position with his affiliate with a film that he's creating.

Anticipating Excellence
By Darryll J. Pines
January 24, 2024
This past Sunday, we welcomed four new Terps to the University of Maryland family, and acceptance letters will be delivered to thousands more of our future undergraduates later this month.
The excitement and the optimism expressed by our #NowATerp families matches the sense of hope I feel for the semester we begin today.
Like them, I anticipate excellence in what lies ahead. Academic pursuits and new ways of thinking that we have not yet imagined. The thrill of a scene-stealing performance or an athletic triumph. Countless opportunities to Do Good.
I hope you draw on the enthusiasm of our newest Terps and embrace the possibilities of a new year and a fresh start. May spring 2024 be your best semester yet!
Sincerely,
Darryll J. Pines

Standing the Testudo of Time
From Turtlenappings to TikTok Shenanigans, How an Unassuming Reptile Evolved to Represent Terp Spirit
By
 Maryland Today Staff

 
 
 Jan 26, 2024

Let’s be honest. A turtle’s an odd choice for a college mascot, up there with Syracuse’s Otto the Orange, UC Santa Cruz’s Sammy the Slug and Stanford’s Tree.
Turtles are slow. Most aren’t big, strong or intimidating. They can’t leap, mountain lion-like, out of a tree to maul you, or crack you one across the noggin with a shillelagh—and really, is that a bad thing?
Instead, these can-do reptiles impress with their positive attributes: They’re persistent and tough. Diamondback terrapins scream (as if turtles make a lot of noise) “Maryland pride” in a state where residents don scarves, overalls and even suits in the flag’s colors.
The University of Maryland loves its Testudo, in every form the mascot takes. He’s the gravitas-heavy, inspirational bronze sculpture that students make offerings to during finals. He’s the furry goofball that dances in the student section at football games, that wears a yellow rain hat and poncho with adorable panache. He’s the logo on our hoodies, the pin on our lapels.
He’s at the center of UMD’s most treasured traditions. And he might have originally been a she.
Testudo has evolved in more ways than one. With the help of University Archivist Emerita Anne Turkos, we delve into our mascot’s muddy origin story, his role in an outrageous, yearslong prank war and his wackiest iterations.
“There are few things I enjoy talking about more than Testudo,” she says. “There’s no mascot quite like him, and he’s had quite a history.”
A Symbol Emerges
Taxidermied Testudo photo by John T. Consoli
Millennia before “Terp” became a Maryland moniker, it was on the region’s menu. Bountiful and easy to catch, the terrapin provided sustenance to Native Americans; once it made the Colonial culinary cut, you could find it roasted, poached and stewed with cream and sherry. By the early 20th century, the hero of these dishes was so popular that the species faced extinction.
In 1932, 11 years after he christened the student newspaper The Diamondback, then-Vice President Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd lobbied for the reptile (scientific name: Testudines) to serve as the university’s mascot—and replace student-athletes’ identity as the Old Liners. When the Class of 1933 proposed a terrapin statue for its class gift, Byrd arranged for a diamondback to be plucked from the waters of Crisfield, Md., to serve as a model. Named the “Archbishop” by students (and assumed to be male—although a 2018 analysis suggests it may indeed have been female), the 13-inch terrapin traveled by train to Gorham Manufacturing Co. in Rhode Island with the student government association president. There, sculptor Aristide Cianfarani designed a giant replica in bronze, which Gorham cast.
Archie returned to campus, but her—or his?—fame was short-lived. The terrapin died days after two holes were drilled into its shell to fashion a ribbon pull for the elaborate (and slow) unveiling of the 5-foot-long likeness at a ceremony in front of Ritchie Coliseum. The likely cause: stress and the hot weather. (Drilling the holes, it was determined, did not hurt the terrapin.)
Terrapin Travails
Who would have guessed a 300-pound bronze statue was so portable? And yet, the shiny new mascot was pulled from his pedestal just before the first anniversary of its installation. The turtlenappers brazenly painted “J.H.U.” in green on the now-empty perch, the first in a trail of “clues” that led UMD to the sculpture outside a Johns Hopkins University dorm the very day it went missing.
It was just the first of Testudo’s 12 disappearances in 15 years, The Diamondback reported in 1958. Some pranks were linked to the UMD-Hopkins lacrosse rivalry, but Georgetown, George Washington and even Loyola University of Maryland students pitched in as well; at their most ambitious, the thieves took the turtle on unsanctioned trips to the University of Virginia and, according to rumor, as far away as Florida. A 1947 caper, in which Hopkins students buried Testudo in Baltimore, ended with a riot and arrests (and reportedly, an eventual party) after UMD partisans stormed a residence hall at the Homewood campus.
Fed-up UMD administrators packed the statue away in storage for a few years after that. He was then installed outside the new football stadium in 1951—far from getaway-friendly Route 1 and now filled with hundreds of pounds of concrete to prevent further attempts. Then, in 1965, Testudo moved to its permanent (and most visible, theft-deterring) home outside McKeldin Library.

The newest (above), which debuted in 2018 outside of Van Munching Hall, is the only one not made from a mold of the original.
Final Offer(ings)
Photo by John T. Consoli
Besides rubbing Testudo’s nose for good luck, students have left offerings to the statue outside McKeldin during finals week in hope of earning good grades since the 1990s. Like turtles themselves, the tradition has evolved, as gifts of pocket change, notes and flowers turned to beer cans and coffee cups.
In more recent years, Terps’ offerings looked more like pranks, including a life-size cutout of Pope Francis, a toilet and stolen traffic cones; a fire even broke out in the pile in 2013.
Last semester, a coalition of student associations appealed to Terps’ goodwill, encouraging students to instead drop off donations of nonperishable foods for the Campus Pantry at his pedestal.
Drawn to a Turtle
THE ERAS TOUR
Like a comic book superhero, how artists imagine Testudo has radically changed over the decades. (Also superherolike: Testudo’s definitely muscled up.) Illustrations in UMD yearbooks depict him as a delinquent, a ladies’ man, a daydreamer, a sleep-inducing teacher, an astronaut, athlete and proud grad. Here are some standouts:
Reptile Roundup

If you hit the Aberdeen, Md., rest stop off I-95 in the summer of 2006, chances are that a 4-foot-tall painted Testudo greeted you. Same at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, Arundel Mills mall and other popular destinations across the state. For UMD’s 150th anniversary, 50 formidable fiberglass Testudos were transformed into a variety of personas—from a tribute to the Chesapeake Bay and a Mighty Sound of Maryland drum major to a Mutant Ninja Turtle and a spangly disco ball. The Fear the Turtle statues returned to College Park that fall to be auctioned off, raising nearly $300,000 for scholarships. Several ended up in private homes, but 10 remain on campus:
“The Freshman”: Turner Hall lobby
“Champions All”: Hornbake Library lobby
“Hear the Turtle”: near the Band Office, The Clarice
“Kertle” and “College Park Arts Exchange”: The Stamp
“Metalli Terp”: near the Dean’s Office, School of Public Health
“Mutant Ninja Terrapin”: outside the Center for Young Children
“Turning into Super Terp”: inside Gate B, Xfinity Center
“A Turtle Celebration”: outside LeFrak Hall
“Tuxudo”: Moxley Gardens at the Riggs Alumni Center
“Maryland Pride”: outside University House
Suited for the Role

The furry, funny Testudo mascot is the Terps’ top cheerleader. He cartwheels on the sidelines, shakes his turtle tush on viral TikTok dances and poses for selfies with fans. But he didn’t always look this way (and definitely didn’t have these moves).
Since then, dozens of men and women have donned the costume, including Grant Handley ’22, M.P.P. ’23. He shells out what it takes to be Maryland’s mascot:
BE EVERYWHERE (BUT NO OVERLAPS!)
Testudo’s a busy turtle, greeting families during move-in, high-fiving kids during Maryland Day, hobnobbing with the governor during announcements and, of course, attending sports games. But he’ll never be in two places at the same time.
THINK ON YOUR FEET
“A mascot should never be standing around—they should always be miming or reacting to something,” says Handley, who uses props and improv to perform at all times. That includes dealing with difficult opposing fans: “You have to figure out how to defuse that situation.”
KEEP IT MOVING
“We joke that you have to be in ‘mascot shape,’” says Handley. The suit weighs at least 30 pounds—the head is the heaviest part—so the four or five students on the team each year always have to hit the gym.
DON’T SPILL THE BEANS
Team members have to keep their identity a secret from everyone, and they can’t speak or show any skin. (The Oregon Duck’s head falling off at a game last fall was “nightmare fuel,” says Handley).
BE CONFIDENT—NOT COCKY
Testudo’s known for his one-handed chest pound, but he’s not an in-your-face mascot. “He might grab someone’s hat and dangle it in their face. And when children come, he’ll get low so he’s not intimidating,” says Handley. “He’s a friendly, lovable turtle.”

1950s
The first known photograph of a Testudo mascot was in 1951, when Zeta Beta Tau members perched on goalposts in masks, shells and street clothes. By the end of the decade, ZBT mascots were banned for being “costumed poorly” and acting “in a disorderly fashion,” The Diamondback wrote.
Testudo ... Now in 3D!

Standing the Testudo of Time
From Turtlenappings to TikTok Shenanigans, How an Unassuming Reptile Evolved to Represent Terp Spirit
By
 Maryland Today Staff

 
 
 Jan 26, 2024

Let’s be honest. A turtle’s an odd choice for a college mascot, up there with Syracuse’s Otto the Orange, UC Santa Cruz’s Sammy the Slug and Stanford’s Tree.
Turtles are slow. Most aren’t big, strong or intimidating. They can’t leap, mountain lion-like, out of a tree to maul you, or crack you one across the noggin with a shillelagh—and really, is that a bad thing?
Instead, these can-do reptiles impress with their positive attributes: They’re persistent and tough. Diamondback terrapins scream (as if turtles make a lot of noise) “Maryland pride” in a state where residents don scarves, overalls and even suits in the flag’s colors.
The University of Maryland loves its Testudo, in every form the mascot takes. He’s the gravitas-heavy, inspirational bronze sculpture that students make offerings to during finals. He’s the furry goofball that dances in the student section at football games, that wears a yellow rain hat and poncho with adorable panache. He’s the logo on our hoodies, the pin on our lapels.
He’s at the center of UMD’s most treasured traditions. And he might have originally been a she.
Testudo has evolved in more ways than one. With the help of University Archivist Emerita Anne Turkos, we delve into our mascot’s muddy origin story, his role in an outrageous, yearslong prank war and his wackiest iterations.
“There are few things I enjoy talking about more than Testudo,” she says. “There’s no mascot quite like him, and he’s had quite a history.”
A Symbol Emerges
Taxidermied Testudo photo by John T. Consoli
Millennia before “Terp” became a Maryland moniker, it was on the region’s menu. Bountiful and easy to catch, the terrapin provided sustenance to Native Americans; once it made the Colonial culinary cut, you could find it roasted, poached and stewed with cream and sherry. By the early 20th century, the hero of these dishes was so popular that the species faced extinction.
In 1932, 11 years after he christened the student newspaper The Diamondback, then-Vice President Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd lobbied for the reptile (scientific name: Testudines) to serve as the university’s mascot—and replace student-athletes’ identity as the Old Liners. When the Class of 1933 proposed a terrapin statue for its class gift, Byrd arranged for a diamondback to be plucked from the waters of Crisfield, Md., to serve as a model. Named the “Archbishop” by students (and assumed to be male—although a 2018 analysis suggests it may indeed have been female), the 13-inch terrapin traveled by train to Gorham Manufacturing Co. in Rhode Island with the student government association president. There, sculptor Aristide Cianfarani designed a giant replica in bronze, which Gorham cast.
Archie returned to campus, but her—or his?—fame was short-lived. The terrapin died days after two holes were drilled into its shell to fashion a ribbon pull for the elaborate (and slow) unveiling of the 5-foot-long likeness at a ceremony in front of Ritchie Coliseum. The likely cause: stress and the hot weather. (Drilling the holes, it was determined, did not hurt the terrapin.)
Terrapin Travails
Who would have guessed a 300-pound bronze statue was so portable? And yet, the shiny new mascot was pulled from his pedestal just before the first anniversary of its installation. The turtlenappers brazenly painted “J.H.U.” in green on the now-empty perch, the first in a trail of “clues” that led UMD to the sculpture outside a Johns Hopkins University dorm the very day it went missing.
It was just the first of Testudo’s 12 disappearances in 15 years, The Diamondback reported in 1958. Some pranks were linked to the UMD-Hopkins lacrosse rivalry, but Georgetown, George Washington and even Loyola University of Maryland students pitched in as well; at their most ambitious, the thieves took the turtle on unsanctioned trips to the University of Virginia and, according to rumor, as far away as Florida. A 1947 caper, in which Hopkins students buried Testudo in Baltimore, ended with a riot and arrests (and reportedly, an eventual party) after UMD partisans stormed a residence hall at the Homewood campus.
Fed-up UMD administrators packed the statue away in storage for a few years after that. He was then installed outside the new football stadium in 1951—far from getaway-friendly Route 1 and now filled with hundreds of pounds of concrete to prevent further attempts. Then, in 1965, Testudo moved to its permanent (and most visible, theft-deterring) home outside McKeldin Library.

Final Offer(ings)

Besides rubbing Testudo’s nose for good luck, students have left offerings to the statue outside McKeldin during finals week in hope of earning good grades since the 1990s. Like turtles themselves, the tradition has evolved, as gifts of pocket change, notes and flowers turned to beer cans and coffee cups.
In more recent years, Terps’ offerings looked more like pranks, including a life-size cutout of Pope Francis, a toilet and stolen traffic cones; a fire even broke out in the pile in 2013.
Last semester, a coalition of student associations appealed to Terps’ goodwill, encouraging students to instead drop off donations of nonperishable foods for the Campus Pantry at his pedestal.
Drawn to a Turtle
THE ERAS TOUR
Like a comic book superhero, how artists imagine Testudo has radically changed over the decades. (Also superherolike: Testudo’s definitely muscled up.) Illustrations in UMD yearbooks depict him as a delinquent, a ladies’ man, a daydreamer, a sleep-inducing teacher, an astronaut, athlete and proud grad. Here are some standouts:

If you hit the Aberdeen, Md., rest stop off I-95 in the summer of 2006, chances are that a 4-foot-tall painted Testudo greeted you. Same at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, Arundel Mills mall and other popular destinations across the state. For UMD’s 150th anniversary, 50 formidable fiberglass Testudos were transformed into a variety of personas—from a tribute to the Chesapeake Bay and a Mighty Sound of Maryland drum major to a Mutant Ninja Turtle and a spangly disco ball. The Fear the Turtle statues returned to College Park that fall to be auctioned off, raising nearly $300,000 for scholarships. Several ended up in private homes, but 10 remain on campus:
“The Freshman”: Turner Hall lobby
“Champions All”: Hornbake Library lobby
“Hear the Turtle”: near the Band Office, The Clarice
“Kertle” and “College Park Arts Exchange”: The Stamp
“Metalli Terp”: near the Dean’s Office, School of Public Health
“Mutant Ninja Terrapin”: outside the Center for Young Children
“Turning into Super Terp”: inside Gate B, Xfinity Center
“A Turtle Celebration”: outside LeFrak Hall
“Tuxudo”: Moxley Gardens at the Riggs Alumni Center
“Maryland Pride”: outside University House
Suited for the Role

The furry, funny Testudo mascot is the Terps’ top cheerleader. He cartwheels on the sidelines, shakes his turtle tush on viral TikTok dances and poses for selfies with fans. But he didn’t always look this way (and definitely didn’t have these moves).
Since then, dozens of men and women have donned the costume, including Grant Handley ’22, M.P.P. ’23. He shells out what it takes to be Maryland’s mascot:
BE EVERYWHERE (BUT NO OVERLAPS!)
Testudo’s a busy turtle, greeting families during move-in, high-fiving kids during Maryland Day, hobnobbing with the governor during announcements and, of course, attending sports games. But he’ll never be in two places at the same time.
THINK ON YOUR FEET
“A mascot should never be standing around—they should always be miming or reacting to something,” says Handley, who uses props and improv to perform at all times. That includes dealing with difficult opposing fans: “You have to figure out how to defuse that situation.”
KEEP IT MOVING
“We joke that you have to be in ‘mascot shape,’” says Handley. The suit weighs at least 30 pounds—the head is the heaviest part—so the four or five students on the team each year always have to hit the gym.
DON’T SPILL THE BEANS
Team members have to keep their identity a secret from everyone, and they can’t speak or show any skin. (The Oregon Duck’s head falling off at a game last fall was “nightmare fuel,” says Handley).
BE CONFIDENT—NOT COCKY
Testudo’s known for his one-handed chest pound, but he’s not an in-your-face mascot. “He might grab someone’s hat and dangle it in their face. And when children come, he’ll get low so he’s not intimidating,” says Handley. “He’s a friendly, lovable turtle.”

The first known photograph of a Testudo mascot was in 1951, when Zeta Beta Tau members perched on goalposts in masks, shells and street clothes. By the end of the decade, ZBT mascots were banned for being “costumed poorly” and acting “in a disorderly fashion,” The Diamondback wrote.

Beyond the bronze Testudos, thousands more in their likeness have been produced in materials ranging from everyday plastics to exotic metals by 3D printers at Terrapin Works, a unit of the A. James Clark School of Engineering.
“Whenever we’re trying out new technology, Testudo gives us a uniform basis for comparison—and it’s uniquely Maryland on top of that,” says Jim Zahniser, Clark School assistant dean for strategic operations and IT.

THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:
United
We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space. To that extent we depend on one another and are our best selves when we support one another. Accordingly, our actions are guided not only by what is good for self but also by what is good for all.
Respectful
Secure and Safe
Inclusive

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

For women in the Math Department who need encouragement, little pick-me-ups can be found a surprising place: the restrooms in Kirwan Hall.

WE TAKE ON HUMANITY'S GRAND CHALLENGES
WE INVEST IN PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges
We invest in people and communities
We partner to advance the public good
OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

ABOUT TDPS IN THE 2024 HELEN HAYES AWARD NOMINATIONS
1/5
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies advances and transforms the research and practice of theatre, dance, and performance studies through a commitment to inclusive excellence and educational innovation in the performing arts.
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.

We enjoyed conversing about my background in activism and my senior project so much that we met again to talk about filmmaking techniques. I was offered a production assistant position with his affiliate with a film that he's creating.

Media Policy
In a continued effort to keep our community safe during the
 COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Maryland has instituted
 special media guidelines. Please review 
 our Media Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic
 before coming to campus.
The University Communications office aims to service media requests
 with accurate, transparent and timely information. We partner with
 the media to help tell the story of the university and its
 leadership faculty, staff, students and alumni.
As a public institution, the university permits media
 representatives to photograph and film in public, outdoor spaces on
 UMD's campus. We encourage all members of the media who are visiting
 to notify University Communications in advance by emailing 
 mediainfo@umd.edu
 , calling 301.257.0073 or communicating
 directly with any member of the University Communications staff. This
 allows us to help coordinate interviews, if possible, offer parking options
 and provide helpful information. Exceptions include members of the media
 covering athletic events. These individuals should coordinate directly
 with the 
 Maryland Athletics media relations team
MEDIA POLICY AND FAQS
On-Campus Filming
News media who plan to film or photograph on UMD's campus
 are asked to notify University Communications in advance. As a public
 institution, the university permits media representatives to photograph
 and film in public, outdoor spaces on UMD's campus. However, media are
 not permitted to photograph or film inside any building on campus without
 explicit permission from University Communications.
All commercial filming and photography must be coordinated
 and approved through the University Communications office in advance.
 All requests for commercial filming on campus must be accompanied by
 a completed filming application. Filming fees may apply. Applications

The University of Maryland (UMD) is committed to our graduate students and to the more than 230 programs in which they are enrolled. Our graduate student community consists of approximately 10,500 students, 4,600 of whom are pursuing a PhD, 5,200 who are enrolled in traditional and professional master’s programs, and nearly 700 who are not yet seeking a degree but are enrolled in graduate courses or certificate programs. International students make up more than 40 percent of our graduate student population, women comprise close to 50 percent, and minorities comprise nearly 20 percent. We pride ourselves on our diverse and stimulating campus culture.
In many ways, graduate study is an apprenticeship. To be successful, you must commit to hours of concentrated work, independent research, and original writing. Graduate work takes time, patience, focus, discipline, and the willingness to make many personal sacrifices. Despite those challenges, the UMD campus, the Washington, DC metropolitan area, and the graduate student community can provide a most agreeable environment.
We are delighted that you are considering a graduate program at the University of Maryland, College Park. We offer a wide array of distinguished programs in many disciplines, and we encourage you to explore them to find the one that best aligns with your interests. Please be sure to read all instructions and requirements carefully to ensure a proper and complete application, and to avoid mistakes that may delay the consideration of your application. Also, remember that the Graduate School and your program of interest are here to help guide you through the admissions process. Feel free to contact us with questions.

The University of Maryland aims for excellence in all things. We are committed to providing students from all backgrounds with pathways to accessible and affordable education by opening doors for talent and promise.
  The University of Maryland has launched a new investment in need-based financial aid, the Terrapin Commitment program, which will provide up to $20 million annually for students from the state of Maryland.
The goal of the Terrapin Commitment program is to reduce the gap between a student’s total financial aid package and the cost of an education. The program began in January 2023 ensuring that tuition and fees are fully covered for Pell eligible, in-state students who are enrolled full-time and have unmet financial need. Learn more>>

HOME TERRAPIN COMMITMENT
Terrapin Commitment
The University of Maryland has launched a new investment in need-based financial aid, providing up to $20 million annually for students from the state of Maryland.
“Since day one of my presidency, I have emphasized the importance of increasing financial support and access to our university. Every Maryland student deserves an equal opportunity to attend the state’s flagship university, and the Terrapin Commitment grant is one more measure we are taking to ensure that a University of Maryland education is affordable to all residents of our state.” —UMD President, Darryll J. Pines
This Terrapin Commitment, the largest single-year investment in need-based scholarships in our university’s history, is designed to ensure that a UMD education is affordable to all residents of our state. The goal of the Terrapin Commitment grant is to reduce the gap between a student’s total financial aid package and the actual cost of an education. Terrapin Commitment began in January 2023, ensuring that UMD’s standard in-state tuition and fees are fully covered for Pell-eligible, in-state students who are enrolled full-time and have unmet financial need, dramatically reducing the financial barriers to obtaining a higher education for low-income Marylanders.
“In alignment with our Fearlessly Forward strategic plan, we continue to find new and meaningful ways to invest in people and communities. Our investments in need-based financial aid better position us to serve the people of our state—opening the door for more Marylanders to attend a world-class flagship institution.” —UMD Senior Vice President and Provost Jennifer King Rice
If an eligible UMD student’s funding sources—including scholarships, grants and the expected family contribution—fall below standard in-state UMD tuition and mandatory fees, Terrapin Commitment will pay the difference. Additional information about eligibility and frequently asked questions can be found below.
ELIGIBILITY
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
To be considered for the Terrapin Commitment grant, students must meet the following criteria:
Be classified as an undergraduate, degree-seeking in-state student.
Enroll full-time (12+ credits) per semester (Fall/Spring).
Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year and qualify to receive the Federal Pell Grant. If ineligible for federal financial aid, complete the Maryland State Financial Aid Application (MSFAA) and qualify to receive the state's Educational Assistance Grant or the Guaranteed Access Grant.
Maintain satisfactory academic progress.

Accessibility
Welcome!
Maryland is a wonderful and diverse community. Diversity is one of our core values and our campus is strengthened and enriched by people with disabilities. Accessibility is an approach to communication and engagement that recognizes the intersectional identities, experiences, and needs of our entire campus community. It goes beyond legal accommodations for students, staff and faculty with disabilities. We work towards making this a community where we each can bring our whole self to campus, where we each have the opportunity to thrive.
We do this in three main ways:
by working towards building a strong community of people with disabilities on our campus
by interrupting structural, attitudinal and institutional barriers that hinder equal access to university-sponsored programs and activities
by being a community that values all persons with disabilities as integral members of our campus community
This website is designed to connect people with services and information related to all aspects of accessibility. If you are experiencing difficulty accessing a university website, or content located on a university website (video, document, etc.), please contact itaccessibility@umd.edu.
The ADA/504 coordinator's office guides the university's efforts to move beyond compliance and toward seamless access. As the university's focal point for disability-related initiatives, the ADA/504 coordinator's office collaborates with university offices, government agencies and advocacy groups to inform decision-making and ensure university compliance with state and federal mandates. The office addresses accessibility issues and reports of disability-based discrimination on campus.
To contact the ADA/504 coordinator’s office:

Public Information Request
The Maryland Public Information Act (PIA), gives the public the right to review and obtain copies of disclosable public records, except to the extent the records are protected from release because they fall within a statutorily recognized exemption to the law. Disclosable public records are only those made or received by a unit of State government in connection with the transaction of public business. In addition, the PIA does not require UM to answer informational questions or to create a record to satisfy a request. Your correspondence to the University making a request is itself a public record and may be asked for by other requesters, along with the University’s response.
  SUBMIT A REQUEST
VIEW PDF PIA ACT MANUAL
The PIA is found in the General Provisions Article, §§4-101 through 4-601, of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and accessible through the Maryland State Law Library at www.lawlib.state.md.us.
  The Maryland Office of the Attorney General provides a Public Information Act Manual which contains the law itself, along with narrative descriptions of the manner in which the law applies to different types of requests. The Manual is available to the public on-line, and provides meaningful assistance to members of the public and records custodians. For the table of contents and access to the complete Manual, click here.
Information for University Units
If you receive a request for documents, do not respond to the request yourself. If someone would like to file a request, you may direct them to our portal.
Regardless of whether the request specifically cites Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, the federal equivalent) or Public Information Act (PIA), you should immediately forward the request to the UM Office of General Counsel.
UM has 10 business days to acknowledge a request and a limited amount of time to provide records after a request is received, so acting promptly is important.
Electronic mail messages and voice mail messages created during the transaction of public business are owned by the University and included in the definition of “public record.” This includes records created or housed on personal devices (mobile phones, tablets, email accounts, laptops etc.)
If you have questions or need advice, contact the Office of General Counsel.
Information for Requestors
To review or obtain copies of University of Maryland, College Park records, you must make a written request under Maryland’s Public Information Act (“PIA”).
Requests for information related to Undergraduate Admissions, Graduate Admissions or Transcripts should be directed to those particular offices.
Requests for the University of Maryland, College Park may be filed via U.S. Mail or through our portal. Sending your request to an individual University employee will delay its receipt and processing.
Public record requests for other schools within the University System of Maryland (USM) must be filed directly with that institution. For example, a request for the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) cannot be filed with the College Park campus.
When filing a request, be specific with respect to time frames, contents, and keywords. Inquiries should contain a targeted description of the record to enable the University to locate the requested record. Be simple, straightforward and precise.
Requests which ask for “any and all” records without any other limiters typically result in vague and overbroad requests. In addition, processing such requests incurs high costs for the requester.
Disclosable public records are only those made or received by a unit of State government in connection with the transaction of public business.
Requests may be submitted at any time. However, requests can only be received when the University is open for business. The date of receipt is the date used for processing the inquiry.
Upon receipt, the University will perform a preliminary assessment of your request to determine if the University is the appropriate custodian of the records. The University will also review the request for completeness.
If the request is unclear or unreasonably broad, the University may request that the filer clarify or narrow the request.
Requests are then placed in a queue of other public records requests. Other offices across campus which may have the records sought are notified about the request. This begins the process of identifying, collecting and reviewing potentially responsive materials to a filer. In certain cases, third parties with an interest may be consulted to process the inquiry.
The PIA is not an automatic disclosure process; requests may be denied. There are circumstances when requests for public information may be denied because there is information which is not lawfully available to the public. This may include, for example, personnel records, student education records; records concerning on-going research; classified information; and information considered confidential commercial/financial information.
The University may reject requests for student directory information (i.e. name, address, email address, phone number) when sought for a commercial purpose.
In the procurement context, requests for the following will be denied: line-item pricing, unit price information, a successful bidder’s customer list, evaluation forms and/or score sheets and biographical data on key employees.
In the research context, specific details of on-going research projects will not be disclosed.
The General Provisions Article, §4-330 provides, “If the official custodian has adopted rules or regulations that define sociological information . . . a custodian shall deny inspection of the part of a public record which contains sociological information . . .” Thus, University’s Rules on Public Records Containing Sociological Information are intended to define the conditions under which Sociological Information shall be excluded from inspection and disclosure as part of a public record under Maryland’s Public Information Act.
Your correspondence to the University making a request may itself a public record and can be requested by other filers, along with the University’s response.
The University will respond as efficiently as possible based on factors including the availability of records, the complexity of the request, the volume of materials involved, the number of requests in the queue, and the time required to review the materials for possible redactions to protect the privacy rights of students or employees or other information deemed confidential under federal or state law.
Our ultimate goal is to be responsive to each and every of the almost 500 requests received annually.
Search & Preparation Fees
Pursuant to Section 4-206, to the University may recover its costs for the actual time expended for the search, preparation, legal review and reproduction of records, to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, UM may not charge a fee for the first 2 hours that are needed to search for a public record and prepare it for inspection. Consequently, we encourage filers to be explicit and precise when drafting their requests.
To offer the most efficient customer service, the University requires payment for any estimated amount due before the work is performed. The search, preparation and copying process will begin upon receipt of the total estimated fee. If the actual fee differs from the estimate, the fee will be adjusted accordingly, and you will receive an additional bill or refund as appropriate.
Requesters will be notified in advance of any fees to be assessed prior to execution. The requester will then have an opportunity to revise or narrow the scope of a request to avoid or reduce actual costs.
Please make your money order or check payable to the "University of Maryland" and send it to the Office of General Counsel. You may also hand-deliver this payment. The University does not accept cash through the mail, credit cards, or PayPal.
If the University does not receive your payment within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of our reply, it will presume that you are no longer interested in pursuing your request and close the file accordingly. To obtain the documents, you must submit a new request.
If a filer feels that the University has imposed an unreasonable fee (more than $350) to produce the responsive documents, the filer may seek assistance from the State Public Information Act Compliance Board (GP Section 4-1A-01 et seq.).
Remedies
Comments or questions for the University may be directed to: PublicInformationAct@umd.edu
Filers who disagree with any response to a PIA request, may seek review of the decision in accordance with Section 4-362 of the PIA. In addition, they may seek assistance from the Public Access Ombudsperson under GP Section 4-1B-01 et seq.
If a filer feels that the University has imposed an unreasonable fee (more than $350) to produce the responsive documents, the filer may seek assistance from the State Public Information Act Compliance Board (GP Section 4-1A-01 et seq.).
Freedom of Information Act
Occasionally an individual or entity will submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a Federal Government agency, and the request will include copies of proposals submitted to funding agencies. If a Federal agency contacts you directly with a FOIA request, please immediately forward the request to the Office of Research Administration. Federal agencies often must operate on a 5-day turn-around for FOIA requests, so it is imperative that ORA and OGC work with you to protect from disclosure (1) any information that may give rise to patentable technology, or (2) information not currently known to others in the researcher’s field that if disclosed, could damage the researcher’s chances of publishing finding as an original and innovative contribution to the field. If you believe that portions of the documents should be withheld, provide your ORA Contract Administrator with the appropriate sections and/or page numbers and the rationale for withholding the information. ORA will work with OGC to prepare a letter requesting that the agency withhold this information from disclosure.
Ownership of Emails and Other Records
Maryland's Public Information Act (PIA), Md. Code Ann., General Provisions Article (“GP”) §§ 4- 101 through 4-601, grants a broad right of access to public records while protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens. As a result, a person can request access to University records and, unless the records fall within a list of exceptions to PIA, the University is required to disclose records that match the request. For instance, a requestor might request a copy of the University’s construction contract for new building or budget information. A requestor may ask for state employee email communications. UMD’s computing and digital information resources are the property of the State of Maryland and, as a result, are subject to the PIA. A requestor can even ask for a list of employees' salaries. However, a requestor cannot ask for a copy of an employee's personnel file or a list of employees' social security numbers and home addresses.

Accessibility
Welcome!
Maryland is a wonderful and diverse community. Diversity is one of our core values and our campus is strengthened and enriched by people with disabilities. Accessibility is an approach to communication and engagement that recognizes the intersectional identities, experiences, and needs of our entire campus community. It goes beyond legal accommodations for students, staff and faculty with disabilities. We work towards making this a community where we each can bring our whole self to campus, where we each have the opportunity to thrive.
We do this in three main ways:
by working towards building a strong community of people with disabilities on our campus
by interrupting structural, attitudinal and institutional barriers that hinder equal access to university-sponsored programs and activities
by being a community that values all persons with disabilities as integral members of our campus community
This website is designed to connect people with services and information related to all aspects of accessibility. If you are experiencing difficulty accessing a university website, or content located on a university website (video, document, etc.), please contact itaccessibility@umd.edu.
The ADA/504 coordinator's office guides the university's efforts to move beyond compliance and toward seamless access. As the university's focal point for disability-related initiatives, the ADA/504 coordinator's office collaborates with university offices, government agencies and advocacy groups to inform decision-making and ensure university compliance with state and federal mandates. The office addresses accessibility issues and reports of disability-based discrimination on campus.
To contact the ADA/504 coordinator’s office:
Phone: 301-405-2841
Email: adacoordinator@umd.edu
We welcome you to our campus and we are thrilled you are part of our community!

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

I am playing with my Self, I am playing with the world's soul, I am the dialogue between my Self and el espíritu del mundo. I change myself, I change the world.

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges
We invest in people and communities
We partner to advance the public good
OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:
United
We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space.

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

STUDY FINDS 2021 CICADA EMERGENCE CHANGED FOREST FOOD WEBS
When Brood X cicadas emerged by the billions in 2021 after 17 years underground, dozens of species of birds pulled up a table at a bug buffet, helping to create a cascading series of ecological effects, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland and other institutions. In their publication featured this month on the cover of the journal&nbsp;Science, the team from UMD, including College Park Scholars Life Sciences program alum Grace Soltis, George Washington University and Georgetown University quantified the widespread changes the periodical cicada emergence had on the feeding patterns of birds and its downstream effects on forest food webs.

ABOUT TDPS IN THE 2024 HELEN HAYES AWARD NOMINATIONS
1/5
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies advances and transforms the research and practice of theatre, dance, and performance studies through a commitment to inclusive excellence and educational innovation in the performing arts.
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.

Mission Statement
Studio A, formerly known as The Art and Learning Center, is an interactive center encouraging the self-expression and self-development of the UMD community. We offer a creative outlet for students, faculty/staff, and community members via non-credit courses in the arts. Through our weekly classes and frequent workshops, we provide the opportunity to learn new skills, explore a topic, or pursue a creative passion. In addition, we serve as a creative partner for student groups, campus organizations, and departments by offering a physical space and environment for people to come together and create. We encourage people to engage individually and as a team with different modes of perception and expression.

We enjoyed conversing about my background in activism and my senior project so much that we met again to talk about filmmaking techniques. I was offered a production assistant position with his affiliate with a film that he's creating. Lastly, [my Intern for a Day host] told me that I could intern at his office and use the TV studio for any short film I wanted to make.

Anticipating Excellence
By Darryll J. Pines
January 24, 2024
This past Sunday, we welcomed four new Terps to the University of Maryland family, and acceptance letters will be delivered to thousands more of our future undergraduates later this month.
The excitement and the optimism expressed by our #NowATerp families matches the sense of hope I feel for the semester we begin today.
Like them, I anticipate excellence in what lies ahead. Academic pursuits and new ways of thinking that we have not yet imagined. The thrill of a scene-stealing performance or an athletic triumph. Countless opportunities to Do Good.
I hope you draw on the enthusiasm of our newest Terps and embrace the possibilities of a new year and a fresh start. May spring 2024 be your best semester yet!
Sincerely,
Darryll J. Pines
