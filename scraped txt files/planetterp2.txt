About
PlanetTerp is a website designed to help students at the University of Maryland — College Park (UMD) make informed decisions. We provide a professor review system, grade data for courses and professors, and various tools which aggregate data about UMD and its courses. We hope that you find these features useful!
Goal
Our goal is to provide information that will help all students at UMD make informed decisions.
Review Writing Tips
If you're not sure what to write, here are some suggestions to get you started:
Did you think the exams or other major assignments were fair?
Did you think the professor had reasonable expectations of the students in the course overall?
Were you a fan of the professor's teaching style?
Was the workload appropriate for the number of credits?
Was this course a waste of time or was it beneficial in some way?
How much support were you given throughout the semester (office hours, extra resources, etc.)?
You're welcome to write your review in anyway you see fit, but here are a few tips to maximize your review's readablility and usefulness:
Clearly structure your thoughts through a pros and cons list, spaced-out paragraphs, or another format of your choosing. The community will thank you.
Try to avoid excessive use of caps lock. We promise you, whatever you want to write can be written without caps lock!
While anyone is free to submit a review, anonymously or otherwise, all reviews are manually verified by us before being displayed on the site. Below are some common reasons reviews get rejected:
Reviews like "really bad", "horrible", or "awesome professor" aren't helpful. Elaborate on why you feel this way about the professor! Remember: users who read your review haven't taken this professor and are relying on YOU to help them make an informed decision.
Excessive hostility towards a professor. Negativity or criticism is fine, but insults or accusations are unlikely to lead to an accepted review.
Excessive/unnecessary profanity or any discriminatory language. We won't reject your review for a few swear words, but do try to keep it to a minimum.
Review Accuracy
A common concern with professor review websites is that the reviews aren't necessarily accurate to real life, because a student with a negative experience is more likely to leave a review than a student with a positive experience. This may certainly be true, and you should take this into account when considering reviews.
Additionally, be especially wary of trusting the rating of a professor with a low number of reviews.
Source Code
PlanetTerp is completely open source! Check out our GitHub. Contributions and/or feature requests are welcome.
Credits
Professor and course information comes from a combination of the Schedule of Classes and umd.io. Grade data is obtained from the IRPA via a PIA request. Initial reviews were imported from OurUMD, and initial grade data was from VA Grades.

PlanetTerp is a website designed to help students at the University of Maryland — College Park (UMD) make informed decisions. We have a professor review system, grades for each course and professor, and tools to provide information related to UMD.
This is the second version of PlanetTerp. The first version was written in web.py, and was closed source. It was rewritten in django at the beginning of 2022, which is the version you see here.
All contributions are welcome, whether that be opening an issue with a bug or feature request, or opening a pull request. See below for how to set up PlanetTerp locally.
Setup
PlanetTerp is developed against python 3.9. It's likely that 3.7+ will work as well, but we only officially support 3.9+.
You'll also need to set up MySQL if you haven't already. PlanetTerp is developed against MySQL 8.0, but any reasonably recent version should work.
Once you have MySQL, you'll need to create a database for PlanetTerp. This can be named anything, but you'll probably want to call it something like planetterp.
Note that when you create this database, you must select utf8mb4 as the character set. The collation can be left as the default. The django code expects the database to have a character set of utf8mb4, and in particular the data import described below will fail if you create a database with the default character set (latin1).
Now we can start setting up PlanetTerp:
git clone https://github.com/planetterp/planetterp
cd planetterp
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp planetterp/config.py.example planetterp/config.py
At this point, you should open planetterp/config.py (not planetterp/config.py.example!). It should look something like this:
DB_ENGINE = 'django.db.backends.mysql'
DB_NAME = 'planetterp'
DB_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
USER = 'root'
PASSWORD = ''
SECRET_KEY = 'django-insecure-zt7yxn++)bh)j#wzb)ofgd0^scu9rwr85%=3l%6g1zt(cx!t)_'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    "localhost",
    "127.0.0.1",
]

STATIC_ROOT = None
ADS_ENABLED = False
ADMINS = []
DEBUG = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = None
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = None
EMAIL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS = None
WEBHOOK_URL_HELP = None
WEBHOOK_URL_UPDATE = None
WEBHOOK_FREQUENCY = 20
If you named your database something other than planetterp, you'll need to edit DB_NAME. If you would like to use a different user than root to access mysql, you'll need to edit USER, and if the password for your user is not the empty string, you'll need to edit PASSWORD.
The other fields can be left alone for now. We'll discuss the WEBHOOK_* and EMAIL_* settings in a bit, but they aren't necessary for an initial setup and can be left as None.
Once you're satisfied with your config, continue with your setup:
# this command will take a while to run because it imports some
# initial data.
python manage.py migrate
# courses which have been taught in the past 10 years are considered "recent".
# courses which are not recent are hidden from some displays like search
# and courses taught. Calculating whether a course is recent can be very
# expensive if done on the fly, so we cache it in a database column and require
# manual updates.
# If you skip this step, you site will appear as if it has no courses loaded,
# since recency defaults to false.
python manage.py updaterecency
To start the server:
python manage.py runserver
You'll probably want to create an admin user so that you can see the admin panel and other admin-only items. To do so, run python manage.py createsuperuser. You'll be able to log in using that user to your local planetterp site, and it will have admin permissions. Make sure you chose a password that's at least 8 characters long, or our client-side validation will reject it on the login page.
Advanced Setup
If you'd like to test features relating to the webhooks or emails, you'll need to fill in the relevant settings in planetterp/config.py. To be clear, you don't need to set this up if you don't want to. The site will still work fine, but no emails or webhook messages will be sent.
For webhooks, you can create a webhook url by going to a discord server (which you have the "Manage Webhooks" permission in), right clicking a channel, and selecting "integrations". Then click "Create Webhook" and then "Copy Webhook URL". That value is what you'll set the webhook url setting (either WEBHOOK_URL_HELP or WEBHOOK_URL_UPDATE) to.
For emails, you'll need to specify your email and password in EMAIL_HOST_USER and EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD respectively. Make sure to include the @gmail portion in EMAIL_HOST_USER. Feel free to create a burner gmail account for this purpose if you don't feel comfortable using your personal email address.
It's very likely that you'll also need to turn on "less secure app access" for your gmail account for email sending to work. This setting can be found under https://myaccount.google.com/security -> "Less secure app access".
Contributing
All contributions are welcome!
If you're submitting a PR, see STYLE.md for a style guide, but you'll be safe if you follow existing conventions in the codebase.
