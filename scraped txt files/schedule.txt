This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one and it may be both moral and physical, but [it] must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and never will.
Frederick Douglass
I am playing with my Self, I am playing with the world's soul, I am the dialogue between my Self and el espíritu del mundo. I change myself, I change the world.

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.

OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.

Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
