LIMITED ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS
Several majors at the University of Maryland (UMD) are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP). These programs have limited space and, therefore, have more competitive admission criteria beyond the university’s general requirements. 
Students pursuing these majors may need to complete a series of "gateway requirements" specific to the major they are interested in. This can include completing certain courses, maintaining a specific GPA, etc.

LEP ADMISSION FOR CURRENT STUDENTS
Current students, or internal transfers, are students already at the University of Maryland (UMD) who would like to change their major to a Limited Enrollment Program (LEP). Processes differ depending on your major of interest.
Students interested in Criminology & Criminal Justice or Psychology need to work directly with a department advisor and the College of Behavioral & Social Sciences, once the last required gateway course is completed.
Students interested in any other LEP, need to apply following the process outlined below, which is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
LEP Application Process
The LEP application is made available following the add/drop deadline of each semester. All applicants are strongly encouraged to review their program's gateway requirements prior to completing the application.
Internal transfer students should complete the LEP application either during the semester in which they complete the required gateway courses or at the end of the semester. This timeline is dependent upon the application deadline for the student's preferred major.
Students applying for the fall semester can complete a gateway course during the summer, at either UMD or another institution. In order to be considered, courses must be taken during, or completed by the end of, UMD's Summer 1 Session. Students applying for the spring semester cannot complete gateway courses during the winter term.
Business applicants must complete all coursework by the conclusion of the fall or spring semester (summer coursework will not be reviewed). Only business applicants may submit letters of recommendation (no more than 3) via email to lep@umd.edu, or in-person to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions in the Mitchell Building.

MAKE UMD YOURS
You’ll make the most of your UMD experience not just in the classroom, but beyond. Opportunities to get involved, have fun and make a difference are as rich and diverse as the homemade ice cream flavors at the Maryland Dairy! You won’t only make your home here, you’ll be part of a close-knit community.
Bond with your roommate, meet up with friends at the Food Court in the Stamp. Work up a sweat by playing Ultimate Frisbee or learning to ballroom dance. Pledge a service fraternity, join one club—or 10! Attend a concert or movie screening on campus, belt out the Maryland fight song at a football game. No matter what you want to do, you can find it at UMD.

HOUSING & DINING
Academics aside, when it comes to choosing a college, housing and dining can be big factors.
Where you sleep. There is a variety of housing options, both on and off-campus. The Department of Resident Life and Off Campus Housing Services help Terps find their home away from home.
Where you eat. From vegan cuisine to exotic ethnic menus and comfort-food favorites, UMD’s Department of Dining Services meets the dining needs of our campus community.

Department of Resident Life
Find your home away from home with the help of the Department of Resident Life. Whether you live in traditional-style, semi-suites, or apartment/suite style housing, living on-campus is your opportunity to fully immerse in the Terrapin community, make lifelong connections and be within steps of everything you need for a successful transition to college life. 9 out of 10 UMD freshmen live in the university's residence halls and all university housing has live-in resident assistants and successful upper-class students who can help you find your groove academically and socially.

APPLY AS A FRESHMAN
If you are a high school student or a student with fewer than 12 semester hours or 18 quarter hours of university-level credit beyond secondary school, you should apply as a freshman applicant.
Below you will find information on freshman application requirements and deadlines, a complete list of required application materials and more.
APPLICANT REQUIREMENTS
As prescribed by the Board of Regents, the university expects you, at a minimum, to have completed the following coursework by high school graduation.
The most competitive freshman applicants exceed these minimum requirements, earning a strong A-/B+ or better average in their high school coursework while taking several honors and/or Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate courses and additional academic electives.
4
Years of English
2
Years of foreign language
3
Years of history or social science
3
Years of science in at least 2 different areas
With at least 2 lab experiences

4 Years of math, including Algebra I, Geometry & Algebra II
If you complete Algebra II prior to your final year, you must complete the 4-year math requirement by taking a course that utilizes non-trivial algebra, such as Trigonometry, Precalculus, Calculus, Statistics, College Algebra.
CHOOSING A MAJOR
Whether you know exactly what you want to study or are still figuring it out, we encourage you to explore UMD's academic programs. As you explore you may see that some of our majors are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP). These programs have limited space and, therefore, have more competitive admission criteria.
On the UMD application, you'll select a preferred major. This information will not impact whether or not you are admissible to the university. If you selected an LEP, you will also be reviewed by the specific program to determine admission to your preferred major.
While most students are admitted to their preferred major, some LEP applicants may not be. Students who are undecided or undeclared (working on getting into an LEP) will work with Letters & Sciences advisors to explore their interests or complete LEP gateway requirements.
Benefits of Applying Early Action
We strongly encourage you to apply early action to receive priority consideration for admission, merit-based scholarships and invitations to special programs. UMD's November 1 early action deadline is non-binding and students who submit a completed application by this date will receive an admission decision by February 1. By applying for admission to the fall semester, you will also be automatically considered for admission to the spring semester.

TRANSFER APPLICANTS
TRANSFER TO UMD
Apply as a transfer student if you are a high school graduate who has completed at least 12 semester hours or 18 quarter hours after high school graduation at a regionally accredited college or university.
Below you will find information on transfer application requirements and deadlines, a complete list of required application materials and more.
APPLICANT REQUIREMENTS
Admission to UMD is competitive and the number of students seeking admission exceeds the number who can be accommodated. Admission is based on the overall strength of the student's academic performance and is assessed through a holistic review. In accordance with the Maryland Higher Education Commission and Board of Regents transfer policies, certain applicants from Maryland public institutions are given special consideration and are admitted when space is available.
The university expects you, at a minimum, to meet the following requirements:
High School
To be considered a transfer applicant, you must have graduated high school or have completion of high school equivalency.
College Credits
You must complete at least 12 semester hours or 18 quarter hours at a regionally accredited college or university. (AP/IB credits or placement tests cannot be used toward this requirement.)
If you are in progress of completing 12 credits, please email us prior to submitting an application for guidance on how to complete your application. Email ApplyMaryland@umd.edu with the subject line "12 Credits In-Progress Transfer Applicant".
College Courses
You are expected to have completed English Composition (the equivalent of UMD’s ENGL 101 course) and college-level mathematics (the equivalent of UMD’s Math 107 course or equivalent to the general education fundamental mathematics requirement).
CHOOSING A MAJOR
Whether you know exactly what you want to study or are still figuring it out, we encourage you to explore UMD's academic programs. As you explore you may see that some of our majors are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP). These programs have limited space and, therefore, have more competitive admission criteria.
On the UMD application, you'll select a preferred major. This information will not impact whether or not you are admissible to the university. If you selected an LEP, you will also be reviewed by the specific program to determine admission to your preferred major.
While most students are admitted to their preferred major, some LEP applicants may not be. Students who are undecided or undeclared (working on getting into an LEP) will work with Letters & Sciences advisors to explore their interests or complete LEP gateway requirements.
BENEFITS OF APPLYING EARLY ACTION
We strongly encourage you to apply early action to receive priority consideration for admission and merit-based scholarships. Your application must be complete by the early action deadline in order to be reviewed. Applications that are not complete by the early action deadline will be considered for the regular application deadline.

APPLYING AS AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT
Freshman and transfer students are considered international applicants if they are non-U.S. citizens or non-permanent U.S. residents.

In addition to the freshman or transfer applicant requirements, international students must also satisfy international specific requirements such as English language proficiency and non-U.S. academic credential evaluations.

Below you will find information on international application requirements and deadlines, a complete list of required application materials and more.
APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
In addition to the required criteria for freshman or transfer admission, the Admission Committee will also consider the following factors for all international applicants:
National education system
Types of institutions attended
English language proficiency
Third-party academic evaluations for non-U.S., university level, academic credentials
Additional information about English language proficiency and academic evaluations can be found below, within the application checklist.
FRESHMAN APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS TRANSFER APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
CHOOSING A MAJOR
Whether you know exactly what you want to study or are still figuring it out, we encourage you to explore UMD's academic programs. As you explore you may see that some of our majors are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP). These programs have limited space and, therefore, have more competitive admission criteria.
On the UMD application, you'll select a preferred major. This information will not impact whether or not you are admissible to the university. If you selected an LEP, you will also be reviewed by the specific program to determine admission to your preferred major.
While most students are admitted to their preferred major, some LEP applicants may not be. Students who are undecided or undeclared (working on getting into an LEP) will work with Letters & Sciences advisors to explore their interests or complete LEP gateway requirements.
Benefits of Applying Early Action
We strongly encourage all international students to apply early action in order to receive:
Priority consideration for admission.
Invitations to special programs.
An admission decision by February 1. This will ensure ample time to work through the immigration process and obtain a visa.

UMD's November 1 early action deadline is non-binding and students who submit a completed application by this date will receive an admission decision by February 1. By applying for admission to the fall semester, you will also be automatically considered for admission to the spring semester.

If you are admitted to UMD and hold or intend to seek an F-1 Student or J-1 Exchange Visitor visa, you must provide proof of available financial resources to cover one year’s worth of expenses (tuition, fees, books, insurance and living expenses). You are only required to provide this documentation after you are offered admission to UMD and have confirmed your enrollment.
For information on what documents to submit, please review the International Student & Scholar Services Acceptable Funding page. There you will also find estimated cost of attendance information. Regarding tuition, fees and financing your education at UMD, please keep in mind the following:
Tuition and fees for each semester, as well as other university charges, books and supplies must be paid in full before the first day of classes.
Medical insurance is required for all international students attending UMD.
As a publicly funded institution, UMD is unable to provide financial assistance to international students. You can find other options for financing your education on the Office of Student Financial Aid website

The University of Maryland aims for excellence in all things. We are committed to providing students from all backgrounds with pathways to accessible and affordable education by opening doors for talent and promise.
  The University of Maryland has launched a new investment in need-based financial aid, the Terrapin Commitment program, which will provide up to $20 million annually for students from the state of Maryland.
The goal of the Terrapin Commitment program is to reduce the gap between a student’s total financial aid package and the cost of an education. The program began in January 2023 ensuring that tuition and fees are fully covered for Pell eligible, in-state students who are enrolled full-time and have unmet financial need. Learn more>>

ACADEMIC RESOURCES
To help students visualize and plan for their college years, we encourage you to share the following resources.
Majors & Limited Enrollment Programs
With 100+ majors available, students can explore all their interests to find a career they're passionate about. Some majors are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP) and have more competitive admission criteria beyond the university’s general requirements. 
General Education Program & Four Year Plans
UMD's general education program gives students the opportunity to explore the exciting and expansive range of courses. These courses will expand students’ program of study, challenge their preconceptions and broaden their worldview. Courses emphasize rigor, innovation and creative thinking. Students are encouraged to consider diversity in all its forms and to enhance their learning beyond the classroom, through study abroad, internships, research or other special experiences.
The Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy promotes undergraduate student success by establishing a structured framework and criteria to guide all students to completion of an undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. The university has created 4-year plans and benchmarks for each academic major to keep students on track toward degree completion throughout their academic careers.
Transfer Credit Services
Transfer Credit Services facilitates the evaluation of credit for new students who have earned college credit from another institution or have successfully completed Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) or A/AS level examinations. The Transfer Course Database can be used to look up transfer course equivalencies. Admitted students who have earned college credit in the U.S. may access their preliminary transfer credit evaluation online within three weeks of receiving their offer of admission. To ensure we have an updated record, admitted students should submit a final official transcript as soon as it becomes available.
PRE-TRANSFER ADVISING
The Pre-Transfer Advising program provides support to prospective transfer students from two- and four-year schools before they apply to UMD. Students are encouraged to use pre-transfer advising services to assess their readiness to transfer and estimate their time to degree completion.

LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Every community owes its existence and strength to the generations before them, around the world, who contributed their hopes, dreams, and energy into making the history that led to this moment.
Truth and acknowledgement are critical in building mutual respect and connections across all barriers of heritage and difference.
So, we acknowledge the truth that is often buried: We are on the ancestral lands of the Piscataway People, who are the ancestral stewards of this sacred land. It is their historical responsibility to advocate for the four-legged, the winged, those that crawl and those that swim. They remind us that clean air and pristine waterways are essential to all life.
This Land Acknowledgement is a vocal reminder for each of us as two-leggeds to ensure our physical environment is in better condition than what we inherited, for the health and prosperity of future generations.

UMD's Commitment to Diversity
UMD'S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY
The University of Maryland (UMD) remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
We are strongest when embracing voices, ideas, perspectives, identities and experiences across our campus. Together, we work toward justice. Together we are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.
In support of the university’s overarching mission, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions strives to recruit, admit, enroll and support talented students from diverse backgrounds. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions, the Office of Student Financial Aid and the Office of the Registrar come together as the Department of Enrollment Management to promote the success of these students who then benefit from and contribute to the intellectual, social and cultural life of the university, their communities and the world. We are student-centered and data-supported professionals committed to designing, implementing and providing the necessary services from pre-enrollment to graduation. We focus on providing pathways to an accessible and affordable education for the most promising students from Maryland, across the United States and around the globe.
OUR RESPONSE TO RECENT EVENTS
On June 29, 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the use of race as a factor in the college application review process violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
Darryll J. Pines, president of the University of Maryland released a statement about the ruling and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions wishes to reiterate: Our commitment to diversity remains a top priority for the University of Maryland.
“At a time when students who have historically faced the greatest barriers to accessing higher education are being told that the admission process may become more challenging than ever, we have a clear, loud and true message: we will remain a national leader by encouraging and supporting students of all backgrounds as they apply, enroll and graduate from the University of Maryland. The educational value of campus diversity is one we will not sacrifice.”
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will, of course, ensure that we adhere strictly to the Supreme Court’s decision. In accordance with the ruling, we will no longer consider race and ethnicity as part of our application review factors.
Our admission committee approaches each student’s application with an individualized, rigorous and holistic review, as we assess academic merit, achievements and potential in the context of the opportunities and challenges the student faced. Unfortunately, we can’t glean all of this information from just high school transcripts and test scores. We try to get to know students better through the information provided in their letters of recommendation, essays, and responses to our short answer questions. This year, we’ve added a new short answer question which reads:
Because we know that diversity benefits the educational experience of all students, the University of Maryland values diversity in all of its many forms. This includes (but is not limited to) racial, socio-economic, gender, geographical and sexual orientation. We are interested in hearing about your own life experiences. In a few sentences, will you please describe how you have learned, grown, been inspired or developed skills through one or more components of diversity.
With this question, we are hoping to learn more about how diversity has shaped each student and its impact on how they’ve learned and grown. The key component we are searching for is authenticity. We want to emphasize that we are not asking students to bare any information they are uncomfortable sharing. We are trying to find out how students’ curiosity, interests, experiences and even challenges may have shaped what they will contribute to UMD both inside and outside the classroom.
ONGOING EFFORTS
Throughout the year, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions hosts events to help prospective and admitted students, their families and counselors/advisors navigate the college application and admission processes. A number of these events are designed to celebrate the diversity of our campus and increase access for students who might not otherwise have the resources and opportunities to apply to college. Examples include:
College Access Conference
Maryland Ascent Program
Terrapin STARS
EDGE
RESOURCES
Admission Review Process & Factors
Our office reviews all application components and considers more than 24 factors in our individualized and holistic application review process. We encourage you to learn more about all that goes into reviewing undergraduate applications.

TYPES OF AID
There are various types of financial aid available. These types of aid can be classified as either need-based, meaning you and your family are not able to cover educational expenses, or non-need based, which generally refers to aid you receive based on merit or qualification.
Scholarships & Grants
Scholarships and grants provide funding that you don't have to pay back. These offers are based on financial need and/or academic achievement. Students are automatically reviewed for some merit scholarships if they apply by the early action deadline.
Federal Work Study (FWS)
FWS is a federally funded program designed to assist students in meeting their educational and living expenses through part-time employment. Opportunities can be found both on- and off-campus and are available to students who demonstrate financial need (determined through the FAFSA).
Loans
Loans are borrowed funds that you have to pay back after graduation. Federal loan terms vary based on financial need. The FAFSA is the only application needed to be considered for federal loans. Private loans are not based on need.
Terrapin Commitment
As part of the financial aid offer, Terrapin Commitment funds are provided to eligible students to reduce the gap between offered aid and the actual cost of attendance. For more information on eligibility, please review the Terrapin Commitment page.

HOME TERRAPIN COMMITMENT
Terrapin Commitment
The University of Maryland has launched a new investment in need-based financial aid, providing up to $20 million annually for students from the state of Maryland.
“Since day one of my presidency, I have emphasized the importance of increasing financial support and access to our university. Every Maryland student deserves an equal opportunity to attend the state’s flagship university, and the Terrapin Commitment grant is one more measure we are taking to ensure that a University of Maryland education is affordable to all residents of our state.” —UMD President, Darryll J. Pines
This Terrapin Commitment, the largest single-year investment in need-based scholarships in our university’s history, is designed to ensure that a UMD education is affordable to all residents of our state. The goal of the Terrapin Commitment grant is to reduce the gap between a student’s total financial aid package and the actual cost of an education. Terrapin Commitment began in January 2023, ensuring that UMD’s standard in-state tuition and fees are fully covered for Pell-eligible, in-state students who are enrolled full-time and have unmet financial need, dramatically reducing the financial barriers to obtaining a higher education for low-income Marylanders.
“In alignment with our Fearlessly Forward strategic plan, we continue to find new and meaningful ways to invest in people and communities. Our investments in need-based financial aid better position us to serve the people of our state—opening the door for more Marylanders to attend a world-class flagship institution.” —UMD Senior Vice President and Provost Jennifer King Rice
If an eligible UMD student’s funding sources—including scholarships, grants and the expected family contribution—fall below standard in-state UMD tuition and mandatory fees, Terrapin Commitment will pay the difference. Additional information about eligibility and frequently asked questions can be found below.
ELIGIBILITY
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
To be considered for the Terrapin Commitment grant, students must meet the following criteria:
Be classified as an undergraduate, degree-seeking in-state student.
Enroll full-time (12+ credits) per semester (Fall/Spring).
Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each year and qualify to receive the Federal Pell Grant. If ineligible for federal financial aid, complete the Maryland State Financial Aid Application (MSFAA) and qualify to receive the state's Educational Assistance Grant or the Guaranteed Access Grant.
Maintain satisfactory academic progress.

APPLICATION DEADLINES
Students have different deadlines based on their applicant type and desired semester of entry. Review our application deadlines to determine when you should apply and when you can expect to receive a decision. We strongly encourage all students to apply by the early action deadline for priority consideration.
In order to receive a decision, applications must be complete. Applications are considered complete when the online application and all required documents have been submitted. All materials must be submitted electronically or postmarked by the appropriate deadline for consideration.
Students can track their application status through the Terps Application Portal
It is the applicant's responsibility to confirm receipt of all required materials. It may take up to 10 business days for recently submitted materials to be listed as received.

STUDENT LIFE
We want you to feel at home at the University of Maryland (UMD). We're committed to fostering a campus environment that supports a healthy mind, body and spirit for all members of the university community.
HOME
STUDENT LIFE
MAKE UMD YOURS
You’ll make the most of your UMD experience not just in the classroom, but beyond. Opportunities to get involved, have fun and make a difference are as rich and diverse as the homemade ice cream flavors at the Maryland Dairy! You won’t only make your home here, you’ll be part of a close-knit community.
Bond with your roommate, meet up with friends at the Food Court in the Stamp. Work up a sweat by playing Ultimate Frisbee or learning to ballroom dance. Pledge a service fraternity, join one club—or 10! Attend a concert or movie screening on campus, belt out the Maryland fight song at a football game. No matter what you want to do, you can find it at UMD.
STUDENTS IN ACTION
You’ll make the most of your UMD experience not just in the classroom, but beyond. You won’t only make your home here, you’ll be part of a close-knit community. 
Service Day at the Farm at UMD
GETTING INVOLVED
Looking for a fencing club, a cappella singing group, mock trial team or Buddhist thought and meditation group? We have you covered on this and more.
800+ Clubs
With more than 800 clubs, fraternities/sororities and sports, getting involved at UMD couldn’t be easier.
Athletics
Fear the Turtle! It’s the rallying cry at the University of Maryland, which has one of the country’s most comprehensive and successful athletic programs. From intramural and club sports to our Division I teams, Terps are active.
Always things to do

HOUSING & DINING
College is a big adjustment. Knowing where you'll call home and where you can find a home cooked meal is important. There are many options for living on- or off-campus and students can grab a bite at a dining hall, food court or cafe across campus.

COLLEGE IS A MAJOR INVESTMENT
The University of Maryland is here to help. We offer an array of financial aid programs—including scholarships, grants, loans and student employment—as part of our commitment to making an excellent education affordable.
We understand that without financial support, a college degree would be out of reach for many talented students. UMD has a long history of providing financial support to students of all economic backgrounds. If you need help, we are here to help you navigate the financial aid process and understand your options.

TYPES OF AID
There are various types of financial aid available. These types of aid can be classified as either need-based, meaning you and your family are not able to cover educational expenses, or non-need based, which generally refers to aid you receive based on merit or qualification.
Scholarships & Grants
Scholarships and grants provide funding that you don't have to pay back. These offers are based on financial need and/or academic achievement. Students are automatically reviewed for some merit scholarships if they apply by the early action deadline.
Federal Work Study (FWS)
FWS is a federally funded program designed to assist students in meeting their educational and living expenses through part-time employment. Opportunities can be found both on- and off-campus and are available to students who demonstrate financial need (determined through the FAFSA).
Loans
Loans are borrowed funds that you have to pay back after graduation. Federal loan terms vary based on financial need. The FAFSA is the only application needed to be considered for federal loans. Private loans are not based on need.
Terrapin Commitment
As part of the financial aid offer, Terrapin Commitment funds are provided to eligible students to reduce the gap between offered aid and the actual cost of attendance. For more information on eligibility, please review the Terrapin Commitment page.

ACADEMIC RESOURCES
To help students visualize and plan for their college years, we encourage you to share the following resources.
Majors & Limited Enrollment Programs
With 100+ majors available, students can explore all their interests to find a career they're passionate about. Some majors are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP) and have more competitive admission criteria beyond the university’s general requirements. 
General Education Program & Four Year Plans
UMD's general education program gives students the opportunity to explore the exciting and expansive range of courses. These courses will expand students’ program of study, challenge their preconceptions and broaden their worldview. Courses emphasize rigor, innovation and creative thinking. Students are encouraged to consider diversity in all its forms and to enhance their learning beyond the classroom, through study abroad, internships, research or other special experiences.
The Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy promotes undergraduate student success by establishing a structured framework and criteria to guide all students to completion of an undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. The university has created 4-year plans and benchmarks for each academic major to keep students on track toward degree completion throughout their academic careers.
Transfer Credit Services
Transfer Credit Services facilitates the evaluation of credit for new students who have earned college credit from another institution or have successfully completed Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB) or A/AS level examinations. The Transfer Course Database can be used to look up transfer course equivalencies. Admitted students who have earned college credit in the U.S. may access their preliminary transfer credit evaluation online within three weeks of receiving their offer of admission. To ensure we have an updated record, admitted students should submit a final official transcript as soon as it becomes available.
PRE-TRANSFER ADVISING
The Pre-Transfer Advising program provides support to prospective transfer students from two- and four-year schools before they apply to UMD. Students are encouraged to use pre-transfer advising services to assess their readiness to transfer and estimate their time to degree completion.

LIMITED ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS
Several majors at the University of Maryland (UMD) are considered Limited Enrollment Programs (LEP). These programs have limited space and, therefore, have more competitive admission criteria beyond the university’s general requirements. 
Students pursuing these majors may need to complete a series of "gateway requirements" specific to the major they are interested in. This can include completing certain courses, maintaining a specific GPA, etc.

LEP ADMISSION FOR CURRENT STUDENTS
Current students, or internal transfers, are students already at the University of Maryland (UMD) who would like to change their major to a Limited Enrollment Program (LEP). Processes differ depending on your major of interest.
Students interested in Criminology & Criminal Justice or Psychology need to work directly with a department advisor and the College of Behavioral & Social Sciences, once the last required gateway course is completed.
Students interested in any other LEP, need to apply following the process outlined below, which is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
LEP Application Process
The LEP application is made available following the add/drop deadline of each semester. All applicants are strongly encouraged to review their program's gateway requirements prior to completing the application.
Internal transfer students should complete the LEP application either during the semester in which they complete the required gateway courses or at the end of the semester. This timeline is dependent upon the application deadline for the student's preferred major.
Students applying for the fall semester can complete a gateway course during the summer, at either UMD or another institution. In order to be considered, courses must be taken during, or completed by the end of, UMD's Summer 1 Session. Students applying for the spring semester cannot complete gateway courses during the winter term.
Business applicants must complete all coursework by the conclusion of the fall or spring semester (summer coursework will not be reviewed). Only business applicants may submit letters of recommendation (no more than 3) via email to lep@umd.edu, or in-person to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions in the Mitchell Building.
