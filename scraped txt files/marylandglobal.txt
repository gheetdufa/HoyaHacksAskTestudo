FEARLESS FULBRIGHTS: DR. CHRIS VARGONIAS
"The overall hospitality of the UMD personnel was tremendous, with such a warm welcome to new visiting members, forming the frame of a fascinating experience that I will proudly promote."

INTERNATIONAL ATHLETES: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER GRADUATION IF THEY’RE NOT GOING PRO?
Maryland Athletics—you know them, you love them, you go to their games. Sporting events are an undeniable part of what it means to be a Terp—alums and current students alike can share in the same core memories of walking to SECU stadium or Xfinity Center, cheering as loud as they can when we score, and donning jerseys with an easy pride that lasts a lifetime. 
OCTOBER 25, 2023
HOW TO RECOGNIZE A SCAM
Be aware of scams targeting international students and scholars. Some UMD students have reported receiving calls or emails that their immigration status is at risk and they must pay a fee/fine to avoid being deported. These are scams!

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges
We invest in people and communities
We partner to advance the public good
OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:
United
We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space. To that extent we depend on one another and are our best selves when we support one another. Accordingly, our actions are guided not only by what is good for self but also by what is good for all.
Respectful
Secure and Safe
Inclusive
Accountable

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.

STUDY FINDS 2021 CICADA EMERGENCE CHANGED FOREST FOOD WEBS
When Brood X cicadas emerged by the billions in 2021 after 17 years underground, dozens of species of birds pulled up a table at a bug buffet, helping to create a cascading series of ecological effects, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Maryland and other institutions. In their publication featured this month on the cover of the journal&nbsp;Science, the team from UMD, including College Park Scholars Life Sciences program alum Grace Soltis, George Washington University and Georgetown University quantified the widespread changes the periodical cicada emergence had on the feeding patterns of birds and its downstream effects on forest food webs.

ABOUT TDPS IN THE 2024 HELEN HAYES AWARD NOMINATIONS
1/5
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies advances and transforms the research and practice of theatre, dance, and performance studies through a commitment to inclusive excellence and educational innovation in the performing arts.
The School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at the University of Maryland (UMD) offers undergraduate and graduate programs that rank among the top in the country. The school creates a rich and productive learning environment that is part of a larger, comprehensive liberal arts experience provided in part by the College of Arts & Humanities and with the resources of a public research university. TDPS encourages the development of inclusive and diverse cultural perspectives. Students develop fundamental life skills, intellectual curiosity, creative thinking, problem solving, embodied learning and emotional intelligence—creatively applied to advance human welfare in all its dimensions. Alumni transition to a rich variety of career pathways within and outside of theatre and dance professions, working as arts managers, choreographers, directors, performers, designers, lawyers, business entrepreneurs, professors, published authors, teachers and consultants. The school serves locally and nationally as a model for collaboration, innovation and entrepreneurship.
The educational offerings in TDPS are administered by 16 tenured or tenure-track faculty; numerous adjunct faculty, international guest artists, visiting scholars; 6 administrative staff; and 56 graduate associates. We currently serve about 150 undergraduates in the B.A. Theatre program, about 60 undergraduates in the B.A. Dance program, 27 graduate students in the M.F.A. Design program, 9 graduate students in the M.F.A. Dance program, and 21 graduate students in the M.A./Ph.D. Theatre and Performance Studies program. Visiting artists and scholars regularly enhance these programs and provide additional perspectives that enhance the student experience.

I was offered a production assistant position with his affiliate with a film that he's creating.

Anticipating Excellence
By Darryll J. Pines
January 24, 2024
This past Sunday, we welcomed four new Terps to the University of Maryland family, and acceptance letters will be delivered to thousands more of our future undergraduates later this month.
The excitement and the optimism expressed by our #NowATerp families matches the sense of hope I feel for the semester we begin today.
Like them, I anticipate excellence in what lies ahead. Academic pursuits and new ways of thinking that we have not yet imagined. The thrill of a scene-stealing performance or an athletic triumph. Countless opportunities to Do Good.
I hope you draw on the enthusiasm of our newest Terps and embrace the possibilities of a new year and a fresh start. May spring 2024 be your best semester yet!
Sincerely,
Darryll J. Pines

Standing the Testudo of Time
From Turtlenappings to TikTok Shenanigans, How an Unassuming Reptile Evolved to Represent Terp Spirit
By
 Maryland Today Staff

 
 
 Jan 26, 2024
Testudo mascot photo by Maryland Athletics; historic images of Testudo courtesy of University Archives
Let’s be honest. A turtle’s an odd choice for a college mascot, up there with Syracuse’s Otto the Orange, UC Santa Cruz’s Sammy the Slug and Stanford’s Tree.
Turtles are slow. Most aren’t big, strong or intimidating. They can’t leap, mountain lion-like, out of a tree to maul you, or crack you one across the noggin with a shillelagh—and really, is that a bad thing?
Instead, these can-do reptiles impress with their positive attributes: They’re persistent and tough. Diamondback terrapins scream (as if turtles make a lot of noise) “Maryland pride” in a state where residents don scarves, overalls and even suits in the flag’s colors.
The University of Maryland loves its Testudo, in every form the mascot takes. He’s the gravitas-heavy, inspirational bronze sculpture that students make offerings to during finals. He’s the furry goofball that dances in the student section at football games, that wears a yellow rain hat and poncho with adorable panache. He’s the logo on our hoodies, the pin on our lapels.
He’s at the center of UMD’s most treasured traditions. And he might have originally been a she.
Testudo has evolved in more ways than one. With the help of University Archivist Emerita Anne Turkos, we delve into our mascot’s muddy origin story, his role in an outrageous, yearslong prank war and his wackiest iterations.
“There are few things I enjoy talking about more than Testudo,” she says. “There’s no mascot quite like him, and he’s had quite a history.”
A Symbol Emerges
Taxidermied Testudo photo by John T. Consoli
Millennia before “Terp” became a Maryland moniker, it was on the region’s menu. Bountiful and easy to catch, the terrapin provided sustenance to Native Americans; once it made the Colonial culinary cut, you could find it roasted, poached and stewed with cream and sherry. By the early 20th century, the hero of these dishes was so popular that the species faced extinction.
In 1932, 11 years after he christened the student newspaper The Diamondback, then-Vice President Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd lobbied for the reptile (scientific name: Testudines) to serve as the university’s mascot—and replace student-athletes’ identity as the Old Liners. When the Class of 1933 proposed a terrapin statue for its class gift, Byrd arranged for a diamondback to be plucked from the waters of Crisfield, Md., to serve as a model. Named the “Archbishop” by students (and assumed to be male—although a 2018 analysis suggests it may indeed have been female), the 13-inch terrapin traveled by train to Gorham Manufacturing Co. in Rhode Island with the student government association president. There, sculptor Aristide Cianfarani designed a giant replica in bronze, which Gorham cast.
Archie returned to campus, but her—or his?—fame was short-lived. The terrapin died days after two holes were drilled into its shell to fashion a ribbon pull for the elaborate (and slow) unveiling of the 5-foot-long likeness at a ceremony in front of Ritchie Coliseum. The likely cause: stress and the hot weather. (Drilling the holes, it was determined, did not hurt the terrapin.)
Terrapin Travails
Who would have guessed a 300-pound bronze statue was so portable? And yet, the shiny new mascot was pulled from his pedestal just before the first anniversary of its installation. The turtlenappers brazenly painted “J.H.U.” in green on the now-empty perch, the first in a trail of “clues” that led UMD to the sculpture outside a Johns Hopkins University dorm the very day it went missing.
It was just the first of Testudo’s 12 disappearances in 15 years, The Diamondback reported in 1958. Some pranks were linked to the UMD-Hopkins lacrosse rivalry, but Georgetown, George Washington and even Loyola University of Maryland students pitched in as well; at their most ambitious, the thieves took the turtle on unsanctioned trips to the University of Virginia and, according to rumor, as far away as Florida. A 1947 caper, in which Hopkins students buried Testudo in Baltimore, ended with a riot and arrests (and reportedly, an eventual party) after UMD partisans stormed a residence hall at the Homewood campus.
Fed-up UMD administrators packed the statue away in storage for a few years after that. He was then installed outside the new football stadium in 1951—far from getaway-friendly Route 1 and now filled with hundreds of pounds of concrete to prevent further attempts. Then, in 1965, Testudo moved to its permanent (and most visible, theft-deterring) home outside McKeldin Library.

The newest (above), which debuted in 2018 outside of Van Munching Hall, is the only one not made from a mold of the original.
Final Offer(ings)
Photo by John T. Consoli
Besides rubbing Testudo’s nose for good luck, students have left offerings to the statue outside McKeldin during finals week in hope of earning good grades since the 1990s. Like turtles themselves, the tradition has evolved, as gifts of pocket change, notes and flowers turned to beer cans and coffee cups.
In more recent years, Terps’ offerings looked more like pranks, including a life-size cutout of Pope Francis, a toilet and stolen traffic cones; a fire even broke out in the pile in 2013.
Last semester, a coalition of student associations appealed to Terps’ goodwill, encouraging students to instead drop off donations of nonperishable foods for the Campus Pantry at his pedestal.
Drawn to a Turtle
THE ERAS TOUR
Like a comic book superhero, how artists imagine Testudo has radically changed over the decades. (Also superherolike: Testudo’s definitely muscled up.) Illustrations in UMD yearbooks depict him as a delinquent, a ladies’ man, a daydreamer, a sleep-inducing teacher, an astronaut, athlete and proud grad. Here are some standouts:

If you hit the Aberdeen, Md., rest stop off I-95 in the summer of 2006, chances are that a 4-foot-tall painted Testudo greeted you. Same at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, Arundel Mills mall and other popular destinations across the state. For UMD’s 150th anniversary, 50 formidable fiberglass Testudos were transformed into a variety of personas—from a tribute to the Chesapeake Bay and a Mighty Sound of Maryland drum major to a Mutant Ninja Turtle and a spangly disco ball. The Fear the Turtle statues returned to College Park that fall to be auctioned off, raising nearly $300,000 for scholarships. Several ended up in private homes, but 10 remain on campus:
“The Freshman”: Turner Hall lobby
“Champions All”: Hornbake Library lobby
“Hear the Turtle”: near the Band Office, The Clarice
“Kertle” and “College Park Arts Exchange”: The Stamp
“Metalli Terp”: near the Dean’s Office, School of Public Health
“Mutant Ninja Terrapin”: outside the Center for Young Children
“Turning into Super Terp”: inside Gate B, Xfinity Center
“A Turtle Celebration”: outside LeFrak Hall
“Tuxudo”: Moxley Gardens at the Riggs Alumni Center
“Maryland Pride”: outside University House
Suited for the Role

The furry, funny Testudo mascot is the Terps’ top cheerleader. He cartwheels on the sidelines, shakes his turtle tush on viral TikTok dances and poses for selfies with fans. But he didn’t always look this way (and definitely didn’t have these moves).
Since then, dozens of men and women have donned the costume, including Grant Handley ’22, M.P.P. ’23. He shells out what it takes to be Maryland’s mascot:
BE EVERYWHERE (BUT NO OVERLAPS!)
Testudo’s a busy turtle, greeting families during move-in, high-fiving kids during Maryland Day, hobnobbing with the governor during announcements and, of course, attending sports games. But he’ll never be in two places at the same time.
THINK ON YOUR FEET
“A mascot should never be standing around—they should always be miming or reacting to something,” says Handley, who uses props and improv to perform at all times. That includes dealing with difficult opposing fans: “You have to figure out how to defuse that situation.”
KEEP IT MOVING
“We joke that you have to be in ‘mascot shape,’” says Handley. The suit weighs at least 30 pounds—the head is the heaviest part—so the four or five students on the team each year always have to hit the gym.
DON’T SPILL THE BEANS
Team members have to keep their identity a secret from everyone, and they can’t speak or show any skin. (The Oregon Duck’s head falling off at a game last fall was “nightmare fuel,” says Handley).
BE CONFIDENT—NOT COCKY
Testudo’s known for his one-handed chest pound, but he’s not an in-your-face mascot. “He might grab someone’s hat and dangle it in their face. And when children come, he’ll get low so he’s not intimidating,” says Handley. “He’s a friendly, lovable turtle.”

The first known photograph of a Testudo mascot was in 1951, when Zeta Beta Tau members perched on goalposts in masks, shells and street clothes. By the end of the decade, ZBT mascots were banned for being “costumed poorly” and acting “in a disorderly fashion,” The Diamondback wrote.
Testudo ... Now in 3D!

Beyond the bronze Testudos, thousands more in their likeness have been produced in materials ranging from everyday plastics to exotic metals by 3D printers at Terrapin Works, a unit of the A. James Clark School of Engineering.
“Whenever we’re trying out new technology, Testudo gives us a uniform basis for comparison—and it’s uniquely Maryland on top of that,” says Jim Zahniser, Clark School assistant dean for strategic operations and IT.

Former UMD President C.D. “Dan” Mote, Jr. (1998-2010) began handing out golden lapel pins to VIPs and other outstanding Terps to show off Maryland spirit. The design was tweaked for successor Wallace D. Loh (2010-20), who began distributing them more widely. President Darryll J. Pines is sticking with the practice, sharing his version with everyone he meets.

By the early 20th century, the hero of these dishes was so popular that the species faced extinction.
In 1932, 11 years after he christened the student newspaper The Diamondback, then-Vice President Harry Clifton “Curley” Byrd lobbied for the reptile (scientific name: Testudines) to serve as the university’s mascot—and replace student-athletes’ identity as the Old Liners. When the Class of 1933 proposed a terrapin statue for its class gift, Byrd arranged for a diamondback to be plucked from the waters of Crisfield, Md., to serve as a model. Named the “Archbishop” by students (and assumed to be male—although a 2018 analysis suggests it may indeed have been female), the 13-inch terrapin traveled by train to Gorham Manufacturing Co. in Rhode Island with the student government association president. There, sculptor Aristide Cianfarani designed a giant replica in bronze, which Gorham cast.
Archie returned to campus, but her—or his?—fame was short-lived. The terrapin died days after two holes were drilled into its shell to fashion a ribbon pull for the elaborate (and slow) unveiling of the 5-foot-long likeness at a ceremony in front of Ritchie Coliseum. The likely cause: stress and the hot weather. (Drilling the holes, it was determined, did not hurt the terrapin.)
Terrapin Travails
Who would have guessed a 300-pound bronze statue was so portable? And yet, the shiny new mascot was pulled from his pedestal just before the first anniversary of its installation. The turtlenappers brazenly painted “J.H.U.” in green on the now-empty perch, the first in a trail of “clues” that led UMD to the sculpture outside a Johns Hopkins University dorm the very day it went missing.
It was just the first of Testudo’s 12 disappearances in 15 years, The Diamondback reported in 1958. Some pranks were linked to the UMD-Hopkins lacrosse rivalry, but Georgetown, George Washington and even Loyola University of Maryland students pitched in as well; at their most ambitious, the thieves took the turtle on unsanctioned trips to the University of Virginia and, according to rumor, as far away as Florida. A 1947 caper, in which Hopkins students buried Testudo in Baltimore, ended with a riot and arrests (and reportedly, an eventual party) after UMD partisans stormed a residence hall at the Homewood campus.
Fed-up UMD administrators packed the statue away in storage for a few years after that. He was then installed outside the new football stadium in 1951—far from getaway-friendly Route 1 and now filled with hundreds of pounds of concrete to prevent further attempts. Then, in 1965, Testudo moved to its permanent (and most visible, theft-deterring) home outside McKeldin Library.

Final Offer(ings)

Besides rubbing Testudo’s nose for good luck, students have left offerings to the statue outside McKeldin during finals week in hope of earning good grades since the 1990s. Like turtles themselves, the tradition has evolved, as gifts of pocket change, notes and flowers turned to beer cans and coffee cups.
In more recent years, Terps’ offerings looked more like pranks, including a life-size cutout of Pope Francis, a toilet and stolen traffic cones; a fire even broke out in the pile in 2013.
Last semester, a coalition of student associations appealed to Terps’ goodwill, encouraging students to instead drop off donations of nonperishable foods for the Campus Pantry at his pedestal.
Drawn to a Turtle
THE ERAS TOUR
Like a comic book superhero, how artists imagine Testudo has radically changed over the decades. (Also superherolike: Testudo’s definitely muscled up.) Illustrations in UMD yearbooks depict him as a delinquent, a ladies’ man, a daydreamer, a sleep-inducing teacher, an astronaut, athlete and proud grad. Here are some standouts:

If you hit the Aberdeen, Md., rest stop off I-95 in the summer of 2006, chances are that a 4-foot-tall painted Testudo greeted you. Same at Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, Arundel Mills mall and other popular destinations across the state. For UMD’s 150th anniversary, 50 formidable fiberglass Testudos were transformed into a variety of personas—from a tribute to the Chesapeake Bay and a Mighty Sound of Maryland drum major to a Mutant Ninja Turtle and a spangly disco ball. The Fear the Turtle statues returned to College Park that fall to be auctioned off, raising nearly $300,000 for scholarships. Several ended up in private homes, but 10 remain on campus:
“The Freshman”: Turner Hall lobby
“Champions All”: Hornbake Library lobby
“Hear the Turtle”: near the Band Office, The Clarice
“Kertle” and “College Park Arts Exchange”: The Stamp
“Metalli Terp”: near the Dean’s Office, School of Public Health
“Mutant Ninja Terrapin”: outside the Center for Young Children
“Turning into Super Terp”: inside Gate B, Xfinity Center
“A Turtle Celebration”: outside LeFrak Hall
“Tuxudo”: Moxley Gardens at the Riggs Alumni Center
“Maryland Pride”: outside University House
Suited for the Role

The furry, funny Testudo mascot is the Terps’ top cheerleader. He cartwheels on the sidelines, shakes his turtle tush on viral TikTok dances and poses for selfies with fans. But he didn’t always look this way (and definitely didn’t have these moves).
Since then, dozens of men and women have donned the costume, including Grant Handley ’22, M.P.P. ’23. He shells out what it takes to be Maryland’s mascot:
BE EVERYWHERE (BUT NO OVERLAPS!)
Testudo’s a busy turtle, greeting families during move-in, high-fiving kids during Maryland Day, hobnobbing with the governor during announcements and, of course, attending sports games. But he’ll never be in two places at the same time.
THINK ON YOUR FEET
“A mascot should never be standing around—they should always be miming or reacting to something,” says Handley, who uses props and improv to perform at all times. That includes dealing with difficult opposing fans: “You have to figure out how to defuse that situation.”
KEEP IT MOVING
“We joke that you have to be in ‘mascot shape,’” says Handley. The suit weighs at least 30 pounds—the head is the heaviest part—so the four or five students on the team each year always have to hit the gym.
DON’T SPILL THE BEANS
Team members have to keep their identity a secret from everyone, and they can’t speak or show any skin. (The Oregon Duck’s head falling off at a game last fall was “nightmare fuel,” says Handley).
BE CONFIDENT—NOT COCKY
Testudo’s known for his one-handed chest pound, but he’s not an in-your-face mascot. “He might grab someone’s hat and dangle it in their face. And when children come, he’ll get low so he’s not intimidating,” says Handley. “He’s a friendly, lovable turtle.”

The first known photograph of a Testudo mascot was in 1951, when Zeta Beta Tau members perched on goalposts in masks, shells and street clothes. By the end of the decade, ZBT mascots were banned for being “costumed poorly” and acting “in a disorderly fashion,” The Diamondback wrote.
Testudo ... Now in 3D!
Photo by John T. Consoli
Beyond the bronze Testudos, thousands more in their likeness have been produced in materials ranging from everyday plastics to exotic metals by 3D printers at Terrapin Works, a unit of the A. James Clark School of Engineering.
“Whenever we’re trying out new technology, Testudo gives us a uniform basis for comparison—and it’s uniquely Maryland on top of that,” says Jim Zahniser, Clark School assistant dean for strategic operations and IT.

Former UMD President C.D. “Dan” Mote, Jr. (1998-2010) began handing out golden lapel pins to VIPs and other outstanding Terps to show off Maryland spirit. The design was tweaked for successor Wallace D. Loh (2010-20), who began distributing them more widely. President Darryll J. Pines is sticking with the practice, sharing his version with everyone he meets.

FEARLESSLY FORWARD
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE—VIBRANT AND DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE.
We are a place of learning: a school dedicated to the art and science of education and committed to reimagining teaching and learning inside both classrooms and communities.
We are a campus dedicated to the indisputable value of science and humanities, inquiry, and creativity, and comprising tens of thousands of searchers and discoverers working in hundreds of laboratories, libraries, and collaborative spaces. Strategically located just a few miles from the nation’s capital, our university is a place where new knowledge is pursued, discovered, and championed.
We are also a community, nearly half a million members strong, of diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni; a small city of residents and commuters, first responders and health care workers, learners, artists, and athletes; a place where thousands come to work every day to make a difference. Our diversity is integral to our excellence. And ours is a community that is intrinsically connected to our surrounding neighborhoods and our state, our nation, and our world.
The University of Maryland remains, since our founding, an institution of change and progress, and a proud land-grant flagship campus dedicated to the public good.
Our university is evolving faster than at any moment in its storied history. Our guiding principles are helping us to empower the next generation of leaders, artists, writers, educators, scientists, and global citizens to develop creative solutions to the grand challenges of our times.
NEW STRATEGIC PLAN INITIATIVES
We reimagine learning
We take on humanity's grand challenges

OUR VISION
We must be united in our noble and fearless purpose, because celebrating differences and leveling societal inequities must be among our greatest strengths, because grand challenges demand fearless ideas, and because progress will not be measured in individual achievement, but in our collective accomplishments.
FEARLESSLY FORWARD IN PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE AND IMPACT FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD: THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND STRATEGIC PLAN  presents a bold reimagining of what our university must be to uphold and expand our mission of service to humanity. Our vision is at once ambitious and fearless.
Our Guiding Principles
To improve the lives of every person on Earth, we will reimagine teaching and learning; accelerate solutions to the grand challenges of our time through creativity and discovery; and forge a diverse and inclusive community where our differences are celebrated and equity is relentlessly pursued. Together, we will dedicate ourselves to advancing the public good because our individual well-being is enduringly bound to our collective well-being.
This is our time to reinvent our University. We must reenvision our campus and community as a modern flagship research university for the common good.

History and Mission
History
The University of Maryland traces its history to 1856, when the General Assembly chartered a state agricultural school. The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. 
It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. 
Mission
The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.
Read our entire mission statement (PDF). (Plain text version)
Values
The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is:
United
We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space. To that extent we depend on one another and are our best selves when we support one another. Accordingly, our actions are guided not only by what is good for self but also by what is good for all.
Respectful
Secure and Safe
Inclusive
Accountable
Empowered and Open to Growth

The partnership’s most recent achievements can be found in this annual update.
University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State (MPower) is a collaboration between the state of Maryland’s two most powerful public research engines: the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) — to strengthen and serve the state of Maryland and its citizens.
Since its creation in 2012, MPower has fostered hundreds of collaborations from across both institutions that are growing Maryland’s innovation economy, advancing interdisciplinary research, increasing educational benefits, and addressing the state’s most critical issues.
The partnership is delivering on a vision of collaboration, innovation, and transformative impact across Maryland. Working together, UMB and UMCP achieve INNOVATION and IMPACT through COLLABORATION.

Implementation of the Strategic Partnership Act of 2016
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership Act of 2016 strengthened and formalized the structured relationship between UMB and UMCP, which began in 2012. The law deepens the alliance and energizes UMB and UMCP to pursue even greater transformative change and impact, far surpassing what each institution could do independent of each other.
In addition to formalizing the structure, the law led to more alignment and coordination, and created two new centers based at UMB and UMCP: the Center for Maryland Advanced Ventures and the University of Maryland Center for Economic and Entrepreneurship Development.

Leadership
The University of Maryland Strategic Partnership: MPowering the State promotes innovation and impact through collaboration between the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). The two campuses leverage their considerable strengths to attract exceptional faculty, to better serve students, and to position the state in a new economy. The task of achieving these actions as well as realizing the full potential of the partnership is the responsibility of the Joint Steering Council, whose members have been appointed by the two presidents.
The Joint Steering Council reports to the presidents, who have dual authority for resource allocation and oversight over the partnership’s projects and programs. The Presidents report progress and activity to the Chancellor of the University System of Maryland (USM) and to the USM Board of Regents.
